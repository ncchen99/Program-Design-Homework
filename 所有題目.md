but everybody knows cirno is a \"⑨. Baka\" (a.k.a. an idiot),

so please help her to calculate this.

Problem:

A bus left the Scarlet Devil Mansion (say, `X` station); `A` people
boarded at the start

At Hakugyokurou (say, `Y` station), `B` left and `C` people boarded

At Yakumo-san\'s house (say, `Z` station), `D` people left; so how many
passengers is on board after each station?

但是因為人工處理起來真的太費時了，

請幫她設計一個程式可以自動化的處理完這件任務吧!

別擔心，阿超知道要如何將輸出結果從螢幕終端顯示器中帶到現實的!

A-chao, from CSIE, is helping a poor supermarket salesperson designing
the price tag for the upcoming anniversary event. However, there is way
too much to do it by hand. Please help him design a program to print out
the price tag format. Don\'t worry, he knows how to make things in the
terminal become physical.

The following are the rules for each output lines:

-   Line \#0 / \#4: Filly Packed with the character `"`

-   Line \#1: Start with a backslash `\`, four spaces, **the discount
    percentage which takes 3 character lengths**, the string `%off!`,
    four more spaces, then ends with another backslash.

-   Line \#2: Start with a backslash `\`, one space, the string `Before`
    , two more spaces, a dollar sign `$`, **the original cost without a
    decimal point** using a **field width of five characters (justified
    to the right)**, and ends with another space and a backslash.

-   Line \#3: Start with a backslash `\`, one space, the string `After`,
    three more spaces, a dollar sign `$`, **the discounted cost till the
    second decimal place** using a **field width of five characters
    (justified to the right)**, and ends with another space and a
    backslash.

-   **No leading zero** should be added to any of the printed numbers.

EAN-13
------

### Description

<div>

In Taiwan, manufacturers of goods put a barcode on each product. This
code identifies both the manufacturer and the product. Among a variety
of different formats of the barcodes, one of these is known as EAN-13,
which represents a thirteen-digit number. For example: 4 710367 663270.

The EAN-13 is composed of the following four components:

1.  GS1 prefix: The first three digits usually identify the GS1 Member
    Organization which the manufacturer has joined.

2.  Manufacturer code: This is a unique code (variable-length) assigned
    to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1
    Prefix.

3.  Product code: The product code, which immediately follows
    manufacturer code, is assigned by the manufacturer.

4.  Check digit: This is an additional digit, used to verify that a
    barcode has been scanned correctly.

To calculate the check digit, follow the three steps below:

1.  Numbering the positions from the right (exclude check digit), the
    odd positions in the twelve-digit number are weight of 3 and the
    even positions are weight of 1. Multiply each data digit with its
    corresponding weight.

    For example:

    > data: 4 7 1 0 3 6 7 6 6 3 2 7
    >
    > weight: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3

2.  Calculate the sum of the results from step 1.

3.  Subtract the sum from **the nearest multiple of 10 that is equal to
    or higher than the sum (see hint)**. The result is the check digit.

Write a program that calculate the check digit.

Reference: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number>

### Input

Three integers (1 digit, 6 digits and 5 digits) which form the first
twelve-digit number of the EAN-13.

Arabic to Roman
---------------

### Description

<div>

Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and
are represented by seven different symbols:

> Symbol: I, V, X, L, C, D, M
>
> Value; 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000

For example, 6 is written as VI in Roman numerals, just 5 and 1 added
together.

However, the numerals for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) are written using
\"*subtractive notation*\", where the first symbol (I) is subtracted
from the larger one (V, or X), thus avoiding the clumsier (IIII, and
VIIII). Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL) and 90 (XC), as
well as 400 (CD) and 900 (CM). These are the only subtractive forms in
standard use.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Pokémon GO
----------

### Description

<div>

Ariel likes to play Pokémon GO! Everyday, she will earn `n` poké balls
and want to catch one pokémon. According to the Pokémon's combat ability
`cp`, health points `hp`, and speed `s` when the pokémon runs away,
Ariel needs to use some poké balls to catch the pokémon. Please tell her
whether she can catch the pokémon successfully. If yes, how many poké
balls will remain?

1.  If the pokémon\'s combat ability is less than 100, Ariel only needs
    to use one poké ball.

2.  If the pokémon\'s combat ability is between 100 and 600 (including
    100 and 600), she needs to use 5 poké balls. Furthermore, she has to
    use another 3 poké balls if the pokémon\'s health points are more
    than 100.

3.  If the pokémon\'s combat ability is more than 600, she needs to use
    15 poké balls. Furthermore, she has to use another 10 poké balls if
    the pokémon\'s health points are more than 200.

4.  If the pokémon\'s speed is more than 4, the pokémon runs away after
    Ariel has used 6 poké balls. It means that she can\'t catch the
    pokémon anymore!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Ariel 喜歡上玩 Pokémon GO ! 每天都會得到 `n`
個寶貝球，也都會捕捉一隻寶可夢，捕捉寶可夢所需要的寶貝球數目會根據寶可夢的戰鬥能力
`cp`、血量 `hp` 以及逃跑速度 `s` 而有所不同。

1.  如果戰鬥能力小於 100，Ariel 只需要使用一個寶貝球就可以抓到寶可夢

國中教育會考成績 CAP grade
--------------------------

### Description

<div>

The **Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School
Students(CAP)**, is one of the current Senior high-school entrance
program in Taiwan. The exam regulations and grading rules are as
following:

-   The CAP consists of 5 subjects: **Chinese, English, Mathematics,
    Social Studies, and Science**.

-   Base on the result of each subject, each are divided into
    **\"Excellent\" (Grade A), \"Fair\" (Grade B), and \"Improvement
    Needed\" (Grade C)** three ranks. Within grade A and B, each will be
    further divided into three smaller levels **\"A++/B++\", \"A+/B+\",
    and \"A/B\"**.

-   Each rank corresponds to different amount of **score**, and each
    level corresponds to a different amount of **point**. Both are
    summed up to get the total score / total points. The score / point
    translation table is as following:

    ![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec05/%E5%9C%8B%E4%B8%AD%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%9C%83%E8%80%83%E6%88%90%E7%B8%BE%20CAP%20grade/images/b108e1d8afa0b47514e61aebe0a502e44d24e00a.png)

-   The subjects Chinese, Social Study and Science are graded by the
    number of correct answers. The subjects Mathematics and English, are
    graded by the weighting system. The translation table is as
    following:

    ![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec05/%E5%9C%8B%E4%B8%AD%E6%95%99%E8%82%B2%E6%9C%83%E8%80%83%E6%88%90%E7%B8%BE%20CAP%20grade/images/594132e0d016faba82b2f6264c18461f75bcb122.png)

-   The final result can be represented as \"**score/points(ranks)**\".

Example: Steven\'s grade of each subject is: **CH=43, EN=92.5, MA=79.8,
SO=61, SC=41**. We can know the rank of each subjects is: **CH=A+, EN=A,
MA=B++, SO=A++, SC=B++**. So the total score is 6 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 26,
and the total points 6 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 4 = 26. The final CAP grading
result is `26/26(3A2B)`.

Given a student\'s grade of each subject, please calculate the final CAP
grading result.

Collatz conjecture (3n + 1 Problem)
-----------------------------------

### Description

<div>

**Collatz conjecture**, also known as **3n+1 problem**, which is a
conjecture in mathematics that is about a sequence defined as follows:
Let `S1` be a positive integer which is the start of the sequence, and

-   if `Sn` is **even**, then `Sn+1 = Sn / 2`

-   if `Sn` is **odd**, then `Sn+1 = 3 * Sn + 1`

The conjecture is that for any given positive integer `S1` (\<= 10\^5),
the sequence will reach 1.

e.g. Given `S1 = 22`, the sequence will be:
`22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1`

As students of NCKU, we are interested in this conjecture, please write
a program to help us do some research in this conjecture.

</div>

### Input

A positive integer S1, (1 \<= S1 \<= 10\^5)

### Output

Two integer L, M within a line, where L represents the length of the
sequence and M is the maximum number of the sequence.

Pokémon Go II - Pokémon Gym
---------------------------

### Description

<div>

Ariel likes to play Pokémon Go! She had many battles in pokémon gym. She
needs a tool to record the battle\'s result.\
She had `n` battles. Each battle is three-on-three and each pokémon has
**combat power(CP)**. If the combat power of Ariel\'s pokémon is more
than competitor\'s, then Ariel\'s pokémon wins. If Ariel has more wins
than competitor, she wins the battle. Please record each battle is
\"**Win**\", \"**Tie**\", or \"**Lose**\" and calculate the **win
rates**.\
\
For example,

Ariel had a battle. Her three pokémons\' combat power are 200, 300 and
400, and the competitor\'s three pokémons\' combat power are 100,350 and
400. Then,

**200\>100** Win

**300\<350** Lose

**400=400** Tie

Because Ariel and competitor had the same number of wins, this battle is
\"**Tie**\". Ariel had one battle and the number of wins is 0, then the
win rates is **0/1 = 0.00%**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ariel 最喜歡玩 Pokémon Go!
她參加了很多場道館賽，所以她需要有個小幫手幫忙記錄!\
她參加了 `n` 場道館對戰，每一場中，對方派出 3 隻寶可夢，Ariel 也同樣派出
3 隻寶可夢應戰，每隻寶可夢都有 **CP 值**，CP 值較高的寶可夢獲勝，CP
值相同的寶可夢對戰則為平手，獲勝的寶可夢數量最多的那一方獲勝，若雙方獲勝的寶可夢數量相同時，則這一場為平手，請幫忙紀錄每一場比賽
Ariel 是 **獲勝**、**平手**或是**輸**，並算出**勝場率**。

舉例:

Ariel 參加了一場道館賽，派出了三隻寶可夢，其CP值分別為
200、300、400，而對方派出的寶可夢其 CP 值為 100、350、400\
所以\
\
**200\>100** Win

**300\<350** Lose

**400=400** Tie\
\
雙方各有一隻寶可夢獲勝，所以這場比賽比賽為平手(**Tie**)，而Ariel總共參加了一場比賽，勝場數為
0 ，所以**勝場率**為 **0/1 = 0.00%**

</div>

### Input

First line, an integer n represents the number of battles. Then, there
are 3\*n lines after the first line. (1\<=n\<=50) Each line has two
integer a, b represent combat power(CP) of Ariel\'s and competitor\'s
pokémon, respectively.(0\<=a,b\<=1000)

### Output

You have output n battle\'s results and the win rates. If Ariel wins the
battle, output \"Win\". If Ariel loses the battle, output \"Lose\". if
the battle is tie, output \"Tie\". The win rates is a floating-point
number with two digits after the decimal point.

Caesar Cipher Encoder
---------------------

### Description

<div>

The Caesar cipher (a cipher is a method of encrypting data) is one of
the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. For English
text, the Caesar cipher would work by taking each letter in the
plaintext message and substituting the letter that is `k` letters latter
(allowing wraparound; that is, having the letter **z** followed by the
letter **a**) in the alphabet.

For example, if `k = 3`, then the letter **a** in plaintext becomes
**d** in ciphertext, **B** in plaintext becomes **E** in ciphertext, and
the plaintext message **\"bob, i love you. Alice\"** becomes **\"ere, l
oryh brx. Dolfh\"** in ciphertext. Note that `k` may be negative. It
means that you should substitute the letter in the plaintext message
that is `|k|` letters earlier.

Write a program that prints out the Caesar cipher for the given input
(described in Input Format).

Note: Transform only English alphabet (case-preserving) and preserve
other characters such as Arabic numerals or punctuation.

</div>

### Input

The input contains two lines. Both lines are followed by a newline
character. The first line contains an integer for k (-10000 \<= k \<=
10000), and the second line is a plaintext message.

### Output

Output the ciphertext of the plaintext message in the input using the
Caesar cipher. There is no newline character at the end of the output.

進階版快閃心算 - Advanced Flashing Number Mental Arithmetic
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

**快閃心算（フラッシュ暗算）**是源自日本珠算界的一個數學競技活動。計算者會在螢幕上看到快速出現消失的數個數字，在顯示完成之後必須在約5秒內回答出所有出現數字的總和。覺得聽起來很簡單嗎？參考
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Jd3Mbzup0> 試試吧！

資訊系的阿超覺得『沒錯，就是太簡單了』。於是他設計了進階版的規則：

1.  螢幕上顯示的數字可能是 **6 進位(SEN)、8 進位(OCT)、10
    進位(DEC)，以及16 進位(HEX)**。

2.  每次**出現的數字 K 介於 0 和 999,999,999 之間**。

3.  由於最後的數字可能很大，**回答時必須用 1,000,000,007 取餘數**。

    -   舉例來說，假設總和是 1,000,000,010，由於 3 ≡ 1,000,000,010 mod
        1,000,000,007**，必須回答『3』。**

同時，阿超也出了一些題目，但是太簡單了他不屑自己算。請幫他設計一個程式，可以幫他計算這些題目的答案！

**※題目中沒有加註進位制的數字皆為十進制！※**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Flashing Number Mental Arithmetic（フラッシュ暗算）**is a competitive
game originated from Japanese zhusuan circle. The calculator (a human,
that is) will see several numbers rapidly appear and disappear on the
screen, after it, he/she have to answer the sum of all appeared numbers
in a few seconds. Sounds simple? Try it out at
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Jd3Mbzup0> !

Chao from CSIE thinks that, \"Yup, its way too easy\". So, he designed
the rules for a \"advanced\" version:

1.  The numbers appear on the monitor might be in **Base-6(SEN),
    Base-8(OCT), Base-10(DEC), or Base-16(HEX)**.

2.  Value of every number will be in **between 0 and 999,999,999**.

3.  Since the final number might be extremely large, **you have to
    answer in modular 1,000,000,007.**

    -   E.g., if the sum is 1,000,000,010, since that 3 ≡ 1,000,000,010
        mod 1,000,000,007, **you have to answer \"3\"**.

At the same time, Chao also created some problems, but they are waaaaay
too easy for him to solve. Help him design a program that calculates the
correct answer.

**※ All number in this problem description, unless specified, are in
Base-10(Decimal) ! ※**

</div>

### Input

First line consist of a integer N, represents how many number to sum. 1
\<= N \<= 1,000 Followed by N lines, each consists of 2 integers, S and
K. S denotes the base of K. S ∈ {6, 8, 10, 16} , 0 \<= K \<=

Base-8, it will have prefix \"0\". (e.g. 0123, 0777) If K is Base 16, it
will have prefix \"0x\". (e.g. 0x41414141, 0xDEADBEAF)

阿超做了一個夢。在夢裡，有個熟悉的聲音引導它到了許多間房子，每間裡面都有一間大廳和許多房間。\
**每間房間都恰有兩扇門，一扇只能進，一扇只能出，並連接到其他房間**；\
阿超走進其中一間房間之後持續往前，發現只要它走過了數間房間一定會回到最一開始進去的地方，如此形成一個循環後，他便會被傳送回到大廳，可以選擇一間新的房間進去。

起床之後，阿超覺的這個夢很有趣，便憑借他過人的記憶力紀錄下了每間房間的編號以及他們通往的房間。\
請幫它幫阿超撰寫一個程式，找出每棟房子的房間循環架構。

David dreamed a dream. (Yes, his name is David from now on. \"Chao\" is
just waaaay too weird.)\
In the dream, a familiar voice guided him to a series of houses. Every
of them have a main hall and numerous rooms.\
**Every single room has exactly two doors - one can only be used to
enter the room, and one can only be used to leave, leading to another
room.\
**David found that after he entered a room from the hall, once he
continue traveling into the next room, he will definitely go back the
the first entered room, then he\'ll be allowed to go back to the main
hall, available to choose a new room to enter.

After David woke up, he thought that the dream was interesting, so he
exerted his memorizing gift and recorded the rooms and which room they
leads to, for all the houses.\

輸入輸出說明／Input-Output Description
--------------------------------------

Input 會描述房間的連接狀況。**第一行代表房間數量（ 編號 0 \~ N-1
）**，**接下來 N 行依序代表第 i
個房間的出口連接到哪個房間**。請參考右方的 Sample
1，第一行表示有6個房間，接下來描述 6 個房間的出口：第 0 個房間的出口是第
0 個房間，第 1 個房間的出口是第 3
個房間\...以此類推。本範例中房間的連接情況如下圖所示：\

![input01\_graph.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec08/%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0%E6%88%BF%E9%96%93%20-%20Looping%20Rooms/images/550619018b7d9d4fb669ed8c1a0c3edf0c3b4b10.png)

其中**圓圈代表房間編號**，**箭頭代表出口⟶入口的連接**。\
各個顏色標出了房間形成環的組合，共三個，因此輸出第一行為 \"3 rings\"。

接著根據以下規則印出各個循環：

-   各個循環**之中**以**最小的房間編號為起點**，以`A -> B`的方式連接，直到回到該房間。

    -   也就是說，橘色循環須印出 `2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2`。

<!-- -->

-   各個循環**之間**相比，由**比較小的起始房間編號的優先**印出。

    -   也就是說，本題順序為藍色(0)、綠色(1)、橘色(2)

因此，正確輸出為：

    3 rings
    0 -> 0
    1 -> 3 -> 1
    2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2

The input describes the room connections. **The first line tells how
many rooms are there (indexed 0 \~ N-1)**, then **the following N lines
tells which room the exiting door leads to for room i**. Take Sample 1
as example, first line states that there are 6 rooms, and following N
lines state the next room for each room, e.g. 0th room leads to 0th
room, 1st room leads to 3rd room. The topology of the rooms in Sample 1
is illustrated as below:

![input01\_graph.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec08/%E5%BE%AA%E7%92%B0%E6%88%BF%E9%96%93%20-%20Looping%20Rooms/images/550619018b7d9d4fb669ed8c1a0c3edf0c3b4b10.png)\
**The vertices(circles) represents the room and the index, and the
edges(arrows) represents the exit⟶enter connections.**\
As you can see, each color denotes each \"rings\" that were formed, 3 in
total, so the first line of the output should be \"3 ring(s)\".

Then, follow these rules to print out the rings:

-   When printing **each rings**, **Start from the room with the
    smallest index.** The connections should be formatted as\
    `A -> B`and ends at where you started.

    -   That is, the orange ring should be printed as
        `2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2`.

-   **Among the rings**, those having the **smaller starting-room index
    should be printed first**.

    -   That is, the order of sample 1 should be blue(0), then green(1),
        then orange(2).

Hence, the correct output is:

    3 rings
    0 -> 0
    1 -> 3 -> 1
    2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2

</div>

### Input

The first line contains a integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 500 Following N lines, each
consists an integer K₀ \~ Kₙ₋₁, 0 ≤ K ≤ N-1 s ≠ t ⇒ Kₛ ≠ Kₜ

### Output

The first line should print out how many loops are there, as \"N rings\"
then, print the loops, one in each line, as \"K₀-\> K₁ -\> \... -\> Kₙ
-\> K₀\"

Alpha compositing
-----------------

### Description

<div>

在計算機圖形學領域，Alpha 合成（英語：alpha
compositing）是一種將圖像與背景結合的過程，結合後可以產生部分透明或全透明的視覺效果。
(By [Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E5%90%88%E6%88%90))

在電腦當中，圖片就是一個含有一堆像素的二維陣列，每一個像素都是一個顏色，該顏色可以用數字來表示。因此，一張
m x n 大小的圖片，在電腦中可以用一個 m x n 大小的矩陣來表示。

要進行 Alpha 合成，必須先準備兩張圖片：一張前景 A，一張背景
B。兩張圖當中的每個像素分別以 `Ca`, `Cb` 表示，而兩張圖的透明度則分別以
`Aa`, `Ab` 表示。透明度會介於 0 到 1 之間，0 代表完全透明，1
代表完全不透明。

有了以上參數，我們想要計算兩張圖片合成起來之後的圖片
O，這張合成後的圖片中的每個像素以 `Co` 表示，則 `Co`
可以透過以下算式得知：

`Co = (Ca * Aa + Cb * Ab * (1 - Aa)) / (Aa + Ab * (1 - Aa))`

Alpha
合成的用處非常廣泛，例如：在渲染網頁畫面時，如果有某些畫面元件希望顯示成半透明的，可以使用
CSS 中的 opacity 濾鏡來指定元件的透明度，這個 opacity
濾鏡就是使用了Alpha合成的演算法進行畫面渲染的。

現在，給你一張照片 `image` 、這張照片的長寬 `width`,
`height`、這張照片的透明度 `alpha`，和一個不透明純色背景的顏色
`background_color`，請你將這張照片跟純色背景進行 Alpha 合成。

</div>

### Input

The first line contains foreground\'s alpha value (floating number range
in \[0, 1\]), and background color (integer number range in \[0, 255\]).
The second line contains width and height of the foreground image, both
are integer number range in \[0, 255\]. The following lines contain each
pixel of the foreground image.

### Output

The composited image.

### Loader Code

        float alpha;

        scanf("%f %u", &alpha, &backgounrd_color);
        scanf("%u %u", &width, &height);
        for (int i = 0; i <‍ height; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j <‍ width; ++j)
            {
                scanf("%u", &image[i][j]);
            }
        }

        alpha_composite(image, width, height, alpha, backgounrd_color);

        for (int i = 0; i <‍ height; ++i)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j <‍ width; ++j)
            {
                printf("%u ", image[i][j]);

Combination Again (Oh come on)
------------------------------

### Description

<div>

Although you guys have done Combination in lecture 7 before (right?),
you all notice that a factorial of a large number may cause overflow
even with type `unsigned long`(what a nightmare. We all have learnt that
there is another definition of combination:

C(n, m) =

1.  `1`, if m == 0 or m == n

2.  `C(n - 1, m - 1) + C(n - 1, m)`, otherwise

Please try to calculate the combination again with this definition.

</div>

### Input

A line with two integers represent n and m respectively. (1 \<= m \<= n
\<= 30)

### Output

An integer which represents C(n, m).

Passcode of Treasure Box
------------------------

### Description

<div>

In Henry's dream, there are 10000 treasure boxes. A mysterious sound
says: past paper of PD1 is in the nth treasure box.

Each treasure box has its own passcode. The rule of the passcode is as
following:

The passcode of the **1st** treasure box is `1`\
For other boxes, if **n is an even number**, the passcode is the same as
the`(n/2)th treasure box`.\
If **n is an odd number**, the passcode is the sum of the passcode of
`(n + 1)th treasure box` and that of `(n - 1)th treasure box`.

Please help Henry to find the passcode.

After Henry has found the passcode and opened the treasure box, there is
a letter:\
Here are all of the past paper, but the questions in this midterm are
all newly set by the TAs. XD

小明做了一個夢，夢裡有 10000
個寶箱，奇妙的聲音告訴他，程設一期中考考古在第 n
個寶箱，想要的話可以全部給你，去找吧...

所有寶箱都有密碼，密碼規則是這樣的：

第一個寶箱，密碼是 1\
其餘的寶箱，若 n 是偶數，密碼和`第 n / 2 個寶箱`相同\
如果 n 是奇數，密碼是`第 n + 1 個寶箱` 與 `第 n - 1 個寶箱` 密碼的總和

請問你能幫小明猜中密碼嗎？

Secret Value
------------

### Description

<div>

~~2021/11/05 Updated Description! (Incorrect, Removed)~~

[2021/11/09 **Added information about calculating GCD(a,
0).**]{.underline}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

David is trying to calculate the \"secret value\" of numbers.\
The secret value of integer `N` is calculated as:

1.  **If** `N` **is a one-digit integer, the secret value is itself.**

2.  Split the number into upper part and lower part.\
    If there are an odd number of digits, the middle digit belongs to
    the lower part.

    -   The integer 121088 gets divided into 121 and 088.

    -   The integer 12345 gets divided into 12 and 345

3.  Find the two parts\' **greatest common divisor(GCD)**. The result is
    called `k`.

    -   Please keep in mind that **GCD(a, 0) = GCD(0, a) = \|a\|.**

    -   The result of GCD(a,b) is the greatest non-negative integer k
        satisfices that a = ck, b = dk. Read
        [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Definition)
        to know more.

4.  Sum up `N` **itself** and the **secret value of** `k`.

**David hate huge numbers, so you MUST answer in modular 10007.\
Your work will be judged by** [**running the loader
section**]{.underline}**, so please implement the functions provided!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example (Sample Input 1)

For `N` = 2424, we can split it into 24 and 24, whose GCD is also 24, so
the result `k` of 2424 is 24.\
Now we need to know the secret number of 24 to sum up with `N`.

For `N`= 24, we can split it into 2 and 4, whose GCD is 2, so the result
`k` of 24 is 2.

Since 2 has only one digit, the secret value of 2 is 2

Hence, we can get the secret value of [2424 = 2424 + secret value of 24
= 2424 + 24 + secret value of 2 = 2450]{.underline}

</div>

### Input

A single integer N 1 ≦ N ≦ 2,147,483,647

### Output

The secret value of N, mod 10007

### Loader Code

<div>

Your code will be judge using this program:

        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        printf("%d", getSecret(n));
        return 0;

Complete Binary Tree Traversal
------------------------------

### Description

<div>

Tree is a widely used data structure.

A **tree** looks like:

    Tree:
             1
           /   \
         2       3
       /   \   /   \
      4     5 6     7

can be stored in an 8 elements integer array

     [no_use, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

**Child node**:

    The lower nodes 2、3 linked to 1 are called "the node 1's children".

**Binary tree** is define as :

    For each node, it has at most two children.

**Complete binary tree** can be seen as :

    The tree node is "from top to down, left to right" full.

    Is a complete binary tree:
             1

There are 3 kind of simple traversal can be implemented on tree :

**Pre-order traversal** :

visit current node -\> visit left child -\> visit right child

**In-order** **traversal** :

visit left child -\> visit current node -\> visit right child

**Post-order** **traversal** :

visit left child -\> visit right child -\> visit current node

Please implement the Complete Binary Tree Traversal.

Quicksort
---------

### Description

<div>

**Updated at 11/28**: One more sample revealed. Please refer to sample
3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. You may have learnt
it in PD1 class, but if you want to understand it better, the best way
is to implement it yourself!

The algorithm of quicksort could be describe as following:

1\. You have an unsorted array, the index of first element is called
\"low\", and the index of the last one is called \"high\".

2\. Arbitrarily pick a number from the given array as \"pivot\". The
\"pivot\" is used to \"divide\" the array into two sub-arrays, according
to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. In this
question, **we require you to always pick the last number in array as
\"pivot\"**.

3\. Iterate through the array (except the \"pivot\") to find the index of
\"pivot\". **In this iteration, we keep moving the numbers that are
smaller than \"pivot\" or equal to \"pivot\" to the front of the array,
and keep track of the index of the last number of them**. After we
finishing iterating, the index of \"pivot\" is next to the last number
that is smaller than it.

4\. **Move \"pivot\" to the position we found in step 2**. At this point,
you have \"divide\" the original array into two sub-arrays, but they
both are still unsorted.

5\. Repeat step 1 - 4 on two sub-arrays recursively, **until you find the
length of divided sub-array is 1 or 0**, which is trivially sorted.

We can illustrate this process with array `8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6`:

       l                  h
    1. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // you have an unsorted array, the first index is low, the last is high

       l                  h
    2. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // pick the last one as "pivot", in this case, it is 6
                          p

       l                  h
    3. 8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // move those numbers that are smaller than 6 to the front
       i                  p
       8 5 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 8 is bigger than 6, no action
     s i                  p
       5 8 1 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 5 is smaller than 6, move to the front
       s i                p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 1 is smaller than 6, move to the front
         s i              p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 9 is bigger than 6, no action
         s   i            p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 10 is bigger than 6, no action
         s      i         p
       5 1 8 9 10 7 3 2 4 6 // 7 is bigger than 6, no action
         s        i       p
       5 1 3 9 10 7 8 2 4 6 // 3 is smaller than 6, move to the front
           s        i     p
       5 1 3 2 10 7 8 9 4 6 // 2 is smaller than 6, move to the front
             s        i   p
       5 1 3 2 4 7 8 9 10 6 // 4 is smaller than 6, move to the front
               s        i p

       l                  h
    4. 5 1 3 2 4 6 8 9 10 7 // move "pivot" to the center of two sub-arrays
                 p

       l       h
    5. 5 1 3 2 4 6 8 9 10 7 // repeat it on sub-arrays recursively
               p
    -> 1 3 2 4 5 6 8 9 10 7
             p

    ...

    5. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // Sorted!

It is better that we can trace the sorting process with our eye than
with our mind. So besides implementing the sorting algorithm above, **we
need you to print out the result of step 4 everytime you \"conquer\" the
sub problem**. You need to use bracket `[ ]` to show the range of
sub-array, and put asterisk `*` in front of the pivot in that sub-array.
Please refer to the sample output.

Hope you can totally understand this cool algorithm after this exercise
:D

Write a program which checks the input sudoku puzzle and prints out the
row number and column number of the points that do not satisfy sudoku\'s
requirements.

Note: You only need to implement `check_sudoku` function.

</div>

### Input

The parameter of the check\_sudoku function is a pointer that points to
a two-dimentional integer array, which represents the sudoku puzzle.

### Output

Print out the row number and column number of the points (from left to
right then top to bottom) that do not satisfy soduku\'s requirements.
Each point printed out is followed by a newline character, and is in the
format (row,column).

### Loader Code

<div>

Your code will be judge using this program:

</div>

    #include <‍stdio.h>
    #define NUM 9

    void check_sudoku(int grid_p[][NUM]);

    int main(void){
        int grid[NUM][NUM]; // sudoku puzzle
        for(int i = 0; i <‍ NUM; ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j <‍ NUM; ++j){
                scanf("%d", &grid[i][j]);
            }
        }
        check_sudoku(grid);
        return 0;
    }

The coordinate to the past
--------------------------

### Description

<div>

Matsumoto is a brilliant AI that is built and sent to the past to
prevent a war between humans and AI. When on his way back to the past,
he will receive a set of encoded coordinates indicating where to go.

To decode the coordinates, he has to follow the following steps:

1\. split the received line of characters into two groups: characters at
odd positions and characters at even positions (index starts by 0 and
from left)

2\. sum up the numbers in each group

3\. write these two numbers into hexadecimal

4\. process the two numbers from step 1 if the length of the number is
greater than 1

5\. the coordinate is the concatenate of the result of the two numbers

松本是個聰明的人工智慧，創造他的人想要將他送回過去阻止一場人類與人工智慧的戰爭。在他穿越的過程中，他會收到一份經過編碼的目的地座標，想要將座標解碼需要透過以下的步驟：

1.  將收到的所有字元分成奇數位與偶數位兩組（從最左邊的開始編號，並且從0開始）

2.  分別計算兩組數字的和

3.  將兩個相加的結果以16進位表示

4.  若有和的位數大於1的，則重複上述步驟

5.  將兩組數字計算的結果串接起來（奇數組的結果在左邊，偶數組的在右邊）

那個孤單的數字 - The Lonely Number
----------------------------------

### Description

<div>

這個世界是上時時刻刻都在發生著排擠的狀況，就連數字的世界也是。真可憐。\
給定 `N`
個的數字，依據以下規則將其全部分成三個數字一組的小組，請你找到無法被分組的那個可憐蟲。\
Every second, someone is getting excluded from his group, and so does it
happens in the world of numbers.\
Given N numbers, group them into triads according to the following
rules. Please find the lonely pitiful number.

-   每個數組中的三個數字 a, b, c，必須可以滿足 a + b = c。\
    The 3 numbers a, b, c in each groups must satisfy the formula a + b
    = c.

-   **提供的數字可能重複，但各個成員只能被使用一次**。\
    **Each numbers might be given many times, but each occurrence can
    only be used once.**

    -   E.g.,
        `input = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 8], group = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]], output = [8]`

-   `N` = 3k + 1，`k` ∈ ℕ，必定可以組成 `k` 個數組。\
    `N` = 3k + 1, `k` ∈ ℕ. It is guaranteed that `k` different triads
    can be made.

-   每組輸入皆只有一個正確的孤單數字，但有**可能有不同的分組方法**。\
    Each set of inputs are guaranteed to have only 1 correct lonely
    number, but **might have multiple ways to group the numbers**.

### Sample Description

**nums = \[1, 2, 3, 3\]\
**可以組成`[[1, 2, 3]]`而多餘的 3 會被留下來，因此輸出為 3。\
Can be grouped into`[[1, 2, 3]]`, with the redundant 3 getting excluded,
so the output should be 3.

**nums = \[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 3\]\
**可以被分成`[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [4, 4, 8]]`，或`[[1, 3, 4], [2, 2, 4], [3, 5, 8]]`，皆會留下一個孤單的
3，因此輸出為 3。\
Can be grouped
into`[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [4, 4, 8]]`or`[[1, 3, 4], [2, 2, 4], [3, 5, 8]]`,
both excluding the redundant 3, so the output is also 3.\

</div>

### Input

First line consists a integer, tells how many numbers will be given. 1 ≤
N ≤ 50，N = 3k + 1，k ∈ ℕ Following is N numbers each separated with a
space. 1 ≤ k ≤ 100

### Output

The single lonely number. You don\'t need to mind what are the groups.

Encryption
----------

### Description

<div>

加密演算法通常都是不同替換 (substitution) 與重排 (transposition)
的排列組合。\
替換與重排的定義分別為：

-   **替換 (substitution)**\
    以取代的方式將文字作位移，當文字變成另一個文字時就保護了真正的明文意義。像是
    [Caesar Cipher](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/L6vddcFTIix4)
    與期中考題的 [Trithemius
    Cipher](https://ckj.csie.ncku.edu.tw/#/exam/2021_midterm)
    就是經典的替換加密的範例。

-   **重排 (transposition)**\
    將原本的字串重新排列順序，舉例來說將字串的順序完全顛倒：`PD1 is good`
    變成 `doog si 1DP` 就算是其中一種重排。

在這次的作業裡面，我們要利用下面這幾種方法的排列組合來進行加密：

1.  **交換 (swap)**\
    將整個文字拆成兩份，前後交換，現在以 `1 2 3 4 5 6 `來舉例：

    改動前：`1 2 3`\|`4 5 6`

    改動後：`4 5 6`\|`1 2 3`

2.  **位移 (rotate)**\
    根據指定的左/右及總位移格數移動文字，現在以向 **左** 位移 **2**
    位舉例

    改動前 : `1 2 3 4 5 6`

    改動後：`3 4 5 6 1 2`

3.  **rail fence cipher**\
    給定 key 依照要求挪動文字位置。\
    依照下方範例為例，明文 `P` 對應到的 key 為
    `5`，表示它需要被挪動到第五個位置；明文 `D` 對應到的 key 為 `1`
    ，表示它需要被挪動到第一個位置，依此類推。

    key : `5 1 2 6 9 8 4 3 7`

    明文 : `P D 1 I S G O O D`

    密文 : `D 1 O O P I D G S`

    同樣依照下圖為範例，在這裡的 key 長度為 4 ，明文的長度為 11。\
    在前面八個數字，每四個依照給定的 key
    挪動文字位置，最後三個由於缺一個數字，就依照文字原排序不改動順序。

    key ：`4 1 3 2`

    明文：`P D 1 I`

    `S S O G`

    `O O D`

    密文：`D I 1 P`

    `S G O S`

    `O O D`

4.  [**凱薩加密 (Caesar
    Cipher)**](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/L6vddcFTIix4)\
    給定一個密鑰 `k` ，將文字平移 `k`。\
    舉例來說 `k = 3` ，明文為 `bob, i love you. Alice` 會變成
    `ere, l oryh brx. Dolfh`

5.  [**特里特米烏斯加密 (Trithemius
    Cipher)**](https://ckj.csie.ncku.edu.tw/#/exam/2021_midterm)

    在凱薩密碼中，每個字元都會被平移一個固定的密鑰
    `k`，而特里特米烏斯密碼密碼則會額外多加一個連續的偏移值(會是遞增或遞減，每次移動1)。

    舉例來說， k=1、遞增的狀況下，我們想加密TAs are so
    H4ND5OME，而每個字元的偏移量為：

    `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

    `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14`

    加密文字會是`UCv ewk zw Q4XO5AZS`.

6.  [**維吉尼亞加密 (Vigenère
    Cipher)**](https://ckj.csie.ncku.edu.tw/#/exam/2020_midterm)

    維吉尼亞密碼是使用一系列凱薩密碼來加密文字的算法，透過一組密鑰來進行加密。在凱薩密碼中，每個英文字母都會偏移一個固定的數字。例如，在偏移量為3的凱薩密碼中，`A`
    會變成 `D`，`b` 會變成 `e`，`y` 會變成
    `b`，以此類推。維吉尼亞密碼則是由好幾組不同偏移量的凱薩密碼編排而成，透過一個稱為「密鑰」的字串來決定其偏移值。而這個密鑰僅包含小寫英文字母。

    舉例來說，假設密鑰是
    `abcde`。密鑰中的每個字母會轉為其對應的數字(例如 `a` = `0`, `b` =
    `1`, ... `z` = `25`)：

    英文字母: `a b c d e`

    數字: `0 1 2 3 4`

    要加密 **TAs are so H4ND5OME.** 這段訊息，我們要將密鑰如下排列：

    `a b c d e a b c d e a b c d`

    `0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

    接著根據前一步驟排列的密鑰(2.)，對訊息中的每個**英文字母**(1.)做位移來產生加密的文字(3.)，如下：

    `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

    `0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

    `T B u d v e t q K R D P O H`

    而這段純文字訊息 **TAs are so H4ND5OME.** 會變成 **TBu dve tq
    K4RD5POH.**，即為加密後的訊息，意思是助教好帥 ;-)。

註：**凱薩加密**、**特里特米烏斯密碼密碼**、**維吉尼亞密碼**
只需轉換英文字母(保留大小寫)且保留其他字元例如阿拉伯數字或標點符號。

現在我們要將上面的六種加密方法模組化，總共有 5 種模組加密方案：

**第一種**

1.  將明文 `SWAP`

2.  把剛剛處理過的結果拆做前後兩半

    -   前半部: `凱薩加密`，密鑰為 `13`

    -   後半部: `維吉尼亞加密`，密鑰為 `meow`

3.  將上一個步驟的結果結合起，向 `左` 位移 `3` 位

Image Editor
------------

### Description

<div>

In computer, everything is represented by numbers --- so does image.
Computer stores image as a matrix. A cell in the matrix is a pixel in
the image, and number in the cell represents the color of that pixel.

Today, Ariel wants to do a image editor which can rotate, flip
vertically, flip horizontally and crop images.

There are five operations, rotate(**r**), vertical flip(**v**),
horizontal flip(**h**), crop(**c**), output(**p**) images.

For example, consider an image as follows:

`| 1 2 3 |`\
`| 4 5 6 |`\
`| 7 8 9 |`

1.  Rotate(**r**)

    Two parameters are rotating the image 90 degrees to right or
    left(**l**/**r**) and the number of rotations, respectively. For
    example:

    `r r 10` rotate the image 90 degrees to right 10 times.

    `r l 1` rotate the image 90 degrees to left once.

    If we want to **rotate this image 90 degrees to the right**, we can
    rotate the matrix like this:

    `| 7 4 1 |`\
    `| 8 5 2 |`\
    `| 9 6 3 |`

2.  vertical flip(**v**)

    \"flip\" or \"mirror\" an image in the vertical direction (up-down).

    `| 7 8 9 |`\
    `| 4 5 6 |`\
    `| 1 2 3 |`

3.  horizontal flip(**h**)

    \"flip\" or \"mirror\" an image in the horizontal direction
    (left-right).

4.  crop(**c**)

    Four parameters are left, right, upper, lower boundary. For example:

    `c 1 1 1 3`

    Then the new image is:

    `| 1 |`\
    `| 4 |`\
    `| 7 |`

5.  output(**p**)

    Output the current image!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

在電腦裡，所有東西都是用數字來表達的------就連圖片也不例外。電腦以矩陣的形式來儲存每一張圖片，矩陣裡的格子代表著圖片的像素，而格子裡的數字就代表了該像素的顏色。

今天 Ariel 想要做個圖片編輯器，可以旋轉、垂直/水平翻轉以及裁切圖片。

共有五種操作，分別為旋轉(**r**)、垂直翻轉(**v**)、水平翻轉(**h**)、裁切圖片(**c**)、輸出圖片(**p**)

如果有一張圖片長這樣：

`| 1 2 3 |`\
`| 4 5 6 |`\
`| 7 8 9 |`

經過不同操作，會得到不同的結果。

一、 旋轉(**r**)

後面會有兩個參數，分別為向左/向右旋轉 90
度(**l**/**r**)以及會旋轉幾次，ex:

`r r 10` 向右旋轉 10 次

`r l 1` 向左旋轉 1 次

當我們要對圖片做旋轉時，我們實際上就是在旋轉這個矩陣本身。

如果我們想將這張圖片**向右旋轉 90 度**，那麼就等於是把矩陣旋轉成這樣：

`| 7 4 1 |`\
`| 8 5 2 |`\
`| 9 6 3 |`

二、垂直翻轉(**v**)

從上向下 180 度翻轉。

`| 7 8 9 |`\
`| 4 5 6 |`\
`| 1 2 3 |`

三、水平翻轉(**h**)

從左向右 180 度翻轉。

`| 3 2 1 |`\
`| 6 5 4 |`\
`| 9 8 7 |`

四、裁切圖片(**c**)

後面會有四個參數，分別為左邊界、右邊界、上邊界、下邊界，ex:

`c 1 1 1 3`

經過裁切後

`| 1 |`\
`| 4 |`\
`| 7 |`

五、輸出圖片(**p**)

將目前的圖片輸出!

</div>

### Input

The second line contains 2 integers m & n, indicates the dimension of
the image. And 1\<= m, n \<= 100. The following m lines contain n
integers, representing the image itself. Each integer in the image is in
the range of \[0, 1000\]. Then, an integer x represents the number of
operations. The following x lines are operations, execute operations
according to the operation\'s format.

### Output

Output the current image while executing \'p\' operation. Each number
must follow by a space. You need to print newline at the end of last

Poker Hand
----------

### Description

<div>

There are four people `A` ,`B` ,`C` ,`D` . Each of them has one poker
hand which consists of five cards. Each card in the hand will have both
a suit (`clubs`, `diamonds`, `hearts`, or `spades`) and a rank (`2`,
`3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `jack`, `queen`, `king`, or
`ace`). Write a program that prints out their order **from highest to
lowest**.

The categories of hand, from highest to lowest, are listed below:

1.  straight flush (both a straight and a flush)

2.  four-of-a-kind (four cards of the same rank)

3.  full house (a three-of-a-kind and a pair)

4.  flush (five cards of the same suit)

5.  straight (five cards with consecutive ranks)

6.  three-of-a-kind (three cards of the same rank)

7.  two pairs

8.  pair (two cards of the same rank)

9.  high card (any other hand)

We abbreviate ranks and suits as follows (letters may only be
lower-case):

Ranks: `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t j q k a`

Suits: `c d h s`

Cards are always **compared by rank first**, and only then by suit. We
compare suits using the **\'reverse alphabetical order\'** ranking:
spades (highest), hearts, diamonds, clubs (lowest).

If any number of poker hands are **in the same category**, follow the
rules below (simplified, not the standard way):

1.  straight flush: The one with the higher ranking top card is better.
    If they are the same, compare the suit of the top cards. (for
    straight: `2 3 4 5 6` \~ `t j q k a`)

2.  four-of-a-kind: The one with the higher ranking set of four cards is
    better.

3.  full house: The one with the higher ranking set of three cards is
    better.

4.  flush: Same as 1.

5.  straight: Same as 1.

6.  three-of-a-kind: Same as 3.

7.  two pairs: The hand with the highest ranking pair wins. If they have
    the same rank, compare the highest suit of the highest ranking pair.

8.  pair: Same as 7.

9.  high card: Same as 1.

Note: not allow the use of jokers, and assume that aces are high.

</div>

### Input

The input contains four lines. Each line is followed by a newline
character. These four lines also represent four hands of five cards for
A, B, C, D respectively.

### Output

List A, B, C, D in the order from best to worst according to their poker
hands. Each letter is followed by a space.

基礎字串處理 - Basic String Operation
-------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

給定一個字串 `str1` 以及數個指令，請根據指令對字串進行處理並執行動作。\
可能會出現的指令如下：`PRINT` `REVERSE` `TO_LOWER` `TO_UPPER` `REMOVE`
`COMPRESS`。\
下方是各個指令的詳細解釋；建議各位使用 function 來執行各個指令。\
**每個指令的 output 後必須分行！**

\
Given a string of characters`str1`and a list of commands, perform
operations according to the commands.\
The possible commands are: `PRINT` `REVERSE` `TO_LOWER` `TO_UPPER`
`REMOVE` `COMPRESS`.\
Command descriptions are in the following section. Using functions to
treat each commands is recommended, though not required.\
Remember to break the line after each command\'s output!

### 指令說明 / Command Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PRINT**

-   印出 `str1`當下的狀態。\
    Print the current state of the string

-   這個指令不應該對`str1`做出任何改動。\
    No modification should occur on `str1`

**\
\
REVERSE**

-   將`str1`頭尾顛倒。\
    Reverse`str1`.

-   假設`str1 = "Mine 123! @@"`執行結果應為`str1 = "@@ !321 eniM"`。\
    E.g.`str1 = "Mine 123! @@"`Becomes`str1 = "@@ !321 eniM"`.

-   你應該改變 `str1`的內容並**印出來**。\
    You should modify the data in`str1`and **print the modified
    string**.

**\
\
TO\_UPPER**

-   將字串內**所有小寫字母**轉成對應的大寫字母。\
    Transform **all lower-case alphabets** in the string to upper-case.

-   不需要對非字母的字元做出任何改動。\
    Non-alphabet character remains the same.

-   你應該改變 `str1`的內容並**印出來**。\
    You should modify the data in `str1`and **print the modified
    string**.

**\
\
TO\_LOWER**

-   將字串內**所有大寫字母**轉成對應的小寫字母。\
    Transform **all upper-case alphabets** in the string to lower-case.

-   不需要對非字母的字元做出任何改動。\
    Non-alphabet character remains the same.

-   你應該改變 `str1` 的內容並**印出來**。\
    You should modify the data in `str1` and **print the modified
    string**.

**\
\
REMOVE \<target\>**

-   自`str1`移除所有字元
    \<target\>。所有剩下來的字元必須**向前推移填滿所有空位**。\
    From `str1`, **remove** **all occurrence** of the character
    \<target\>. The remaining characters must be **shifted to the front
    to fill up the blanks**.

-   假設`str1 = ['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', '\0'], target = 'p'`,
    執行結果應為`str1 = ['a', 'l', 'e', '\0']`。有注意到長度變短了嗎？\
    e.g., `str1 = ['a', 'p', 'p', 'l', 'e', '\0'], target = 'p'`, the
    result should be `str1 = ['a', 'l', 'e', '\0']`. Notice the length
    of the string is shortened.

-   **執行完成後至少會留下 1 個字元。**\
    **There will be at least 1 character left in the string after
    removal.**

-   空白`' '`也可能是被移除的目標。\
    Spaces`' '`might also be the target to remove.

-   你應該改變 `str1` 的內容並**印出來**。\
    You should modify the data in `str1` and **print the modified
    string**.

**\
\
COMPRESS**

-   使用 **Run-Length Encoding** 來對`str1`進行壓縮。以下為 Run-Length
    Encoding 的執行步驟：\
    Use **Run-Length Encoding** to compress`str1`. The following is how
    to Run-Length Encoding:

    -   從`str1[0]`開始。\
        Start from `str1[0]`.

    -   計算選到的字元連續出現了幾次。\
        Count the number of **contiguous subsequent occurrences** of the
        picked character.

    -   將其改成`-<字元><出現次數>`的形式。**注意前面有個減號**，用來標示被壓縮的字元。\
        Transform into the form as `-<char><occurrence>` . **Note that
        there is a minus sign in front of the pair**, used to mark which
        character is getting encoded**.**

    -   假設`str1 = "aaaabbbcccikK"`執行結果應為`str1 = "-a4-b3-c3-i1-k1-K1"`。請注意，**大小寫英文字母被視為不同的字元**。\
        e.g., `str1 = "aaaabbbcccikK"` becomes
        `str1 = "-a4-b3-c3-i1-k1-K1"`. Notice that **lower and upper
        case alphabets are considered different characters**.

    -   假設`str1 = "AaaaC@@---  """"`執行結果應為`str1 = "-A1-a3-C1-@2--3- 2-"3"`。請注意，**空白和減號也會被處理**。\
        e.g.,`str1 = "AaaaC@@---  """"` becomes
        `str1 = "-A1-a3-C1-@2--3- 2-"3"`. Notice that **spaces and minus
        signs are also being encoded.**

-   你應該改變 `str1` 的內容並**印出來**。\
    You should modify the data in `str1` and **print the modified
    string**.

### 提示與建議 / Tips and Suggestions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  當在 `scanf()` 中使用 `%s` 時，**會取用直到下個 white space
    character**(例如空白`' '`, 換行`'\n'` , 水平 / 垂直 Tab`'\t'` /
    `'\v'`等等) **之前的所有字元**。**而這個字元則會留在 input
    中不被讀取**。\
    When using `%s` in `scanf()`, **all inputs until the next trailing
    whitespace character** (e.g., spaces`' '`, newline`'\n'`, horizontal
    / vertical tabs`'\t'` / `'\v'`) **will be consumed**, **but the
    whitespace character will remain untouched**.\
    \

2.  `getchar()` **可以從 input 中移除一個
    character**，可參考以下使用例：\
    `getchar()` **can be used to remove a character from input**. The
    following is a simple example:

<!-- -->

    /* 自 input 中移除一個字元並將該字元賦值給 a。 與 scanf("%c", &a) 相同效果。
       Remove 1 character from input and assign the character to a. Has same effect as scanf("%c", &a). */
    char a = getchar(); 

    /* 僅自 input 中移除一個字元。
       Remove 1 character from input. No assignment happens here. */
    getchar();

3.  `==`**無法用來比較字串** 。\
    `==`**cannot be used to compare strings.\
    \
    **

4.  **你必須在字串結束處加上** `'\0'` **來標示字串終結。\
    **`'\0'`**is required and used to mark the end of character array
    strings.\
    \
    **

5.  每個可以成功執行的指令都會讓你拿到一些分數。\
    Every correctly implemented commands will grant you some points.

FORTUNE LOVER 世界的加法規則
----------------------------

### Description

<div>

卡塔麗娜今年就要上小學囉\~
在小學的第一節數學課，老師要教大家怎麼做整數加法！

在 FORTUNE LOVER 裡，整數加法的規則是這樣的：

1.  先把被加數和加數當作 float 看待（以 [IEEE 754
    單精度浮點數的格式](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/IEEE_754)表達）。

    -   所以 1 並不是 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001，而是 00111111
        10000000 00000000 00000000。

    -   然後 2 也不是 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010，而是 01000000
        00000000 00000000 00000000。

    -   如果你不知道怎麼做轉換，可以用[這個網站](https://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_float.html)來幫你，只要在
        Decimal 處輸入一個整數，按下 \"Convert to
        binary\"，就可以知道他的 IEEE 754 表示法是什麼囉\~

2.  將兩個 32-bits 的二進位數字作加法，得到一個 32-bits 的二進位數字

3.  將該二進位數字當作 int
    （[二補數](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E4%BA%8C%E8%A3%9C%E6%95%B8)的有號整數）解讀。

    -   如果該二進位數字是 00000000 00000000 00000000
        00001111，那你就要把他當成 15

    -   如果該二進位數字是 11111111 11111111 11111111
        11110000，那你就要把他當成 -16

    -   Again，如果你不知道怎麼做轉換，可以用[這個網站](https://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_signed_int.html)來幫你，只要在
        Binary 處輸入32-bits 的二進位數字（不要有空白分隔），按下
        \"Convert to Decimal\"， 就可以知道這個 32-bits
        二進位數字對應的整數是多少了\~

舉例來說，如果我們想進行 1 + 2 的加法：

1.  把 1 和 2 當作 float，寫出他們的 bit pattern：

    -   1 = 00111111 10000000 00000000 00000000

    -   2 = 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

<!-- -->

2.  將兩個 32-bits 的二進位數字作加法，得到一個 32-bits 的二進位數字

           00111111 10000000 00000000 00000000
        +) 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
        ---------------------------------------
           01111111 10000000 00000000 00000000

<!-- -->

3.  將該二進位數字當作 int 解讀

    -   01111111 10000000 00000000 00000000 = 2139095040

所以， 1 + 2 = 2139095040。

你是卡塔麗娜的數學老師，為了讓卡塔麗娜更理解這個複雜的加法是怎麼進行的，請你在進行每一題範例講解時都把這個相加的過程清楚的寫出來喔\~

Share Candy
-----------

### Description

<div>

You are a teacher in a kindergarten. Today you bring a bag of candies to
the class, and you want to share them with your kids. Kids all LOVE
candy! They all want as many as they can have. But for the fairness, you
have to give each kid the same number of candies. Given the total number
of candies and the number of kids, how many candies can a kid have? And
how many candies will remain?

Attention: You HAVE TO implement this logic in a function.

你是一個幼稚園老師，今天你買了一包糖糖想要分給班上的小朋友們。小朋友都愛死糖果了，所以每個人都想要儘量得到最多的糖果，但是為了公平起見，每個人分到的糖果數必須要一樣多。給定糖果的個數與小朋友的人數，請問每個人可以得到幾顆糖果呢？最後你會剩下幾顆糖果呢？

注意：你必須將以上邏輯實作在函數裏面。

</div>

### Input

The input consists of 2 integers m, n. m is the number of candies, and n
is the number of kids. Notice that 0 \< n \< m \< 100000.

Cropped Report Card
-------------------

### Description

<div>

考試考完，又到了面對現實的時刻。大雄很緊張，因為他知道肯定會有科目不及格，但是不能給媽媽看到不及格的成績，所以裁切成績單的時刻到了！

裁切成績單的規則是：

1.  裁切後的成績單內只有及格 (大於等於六十分) 的成績

2.  成績數量越多越好，這樣媽媽才不會懷疑成績單是不是被動了手腳

3.  如果數量相等，取成績合最大的區段

舉例來說，現在大雄的成績是 `40 50 60 70 80 50 90`，\
那我們想要找到的成績區段就是 `60 70 80`

請你幫助大雄度過難關！

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the exam, it's time to face the reality.\
Nobita is nervious because he knows that he must have failed some
subjects. He will be in trouble if his mom knows that. It is time to
crop the report card!

The rules of croping reocrd card are listed below:

1.  The cropped report card should only contain the score higher or
    equal to 60 points.

2.  There should be as many score records as possibile.

3.  If the number of score records is the same, choose the section with
    the highest sum of scores.

For example, Nobita's scores are`40 50 60 70 80 50 90`,\
the result should be `60 70 80`.

Please help Nobita overcome this difficulty.

</div>

### Input

A line contain n integers. The 1st number to (n - 1)th number indicate
the score. The nth number is -1 0 \<= score \<= 100 1 \<= n \<= 1000

### Output

The scores on the report card. Each number must follow by a space.

### Loader Code

Modifying Array Problem
-----------------------

### Description

<div>

給定一陣列，利用指標操作，根據給定的模式，將陣列的值做對應的轉換。

規則如下：

一開始給定一個陣列 `arr`，其中的第一個元素（`arr[0]`）代表的是「模式」。

對於接下來的元素（`arr[1]` \~ `arr[SIZE-1]`），我們用一個新的陣列
`newArr` 來講解。

我們讓：

`newArr[0]` = `arr[1]`

`newArr[1]` = `arr[2]`

`newArr[2]` = `arr[3]`

依此類推，`newArr[i]` = `arr[i+1]`。

在 `newArr` 裡，

如果模式為 1，則 index 為 2 的倍數的值將加上 10；

如果模式為 2，則 index 為 3 的倍數的值將乘以 8；

如果模式為 3，則 index 為 5 的倍數的值將減去 2。

最後，將改動後的內容印出來（不包含「模式」的值）。

**注意：須根據給定之** `main` **函式完成** `modify_array`
**函式的實作，請仔細閱讀** `main` **函式的內容 ;) 。**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given an array, please use pointer to modify its elements\' values based
on the provided mode.

The rule is showed below:

We will give you an array `arr`, the first element (`arr[0]`)
means「mode」.

For the other elements (`arr[1]` \~ `arr[SIZE-1]`), we will use a new
array `newArr` to introduce.

Let\...

`newArr[0]` = `arr[1]`

`newArr[1]` = `arr[2]`

`newArr[2]` = `arr[3]`

and so on, `newArr[i]` = `arr[i+1]`.

In `newArr`,

if the mode is 1, then the value should add 10 if its index is the
multiples of 2;

if the mode is 2, then the value should time 8 if its index is the
multiples of 3;

if the mode is 3, then the value should minus 2 if its index is the
multiples of 5.

Then, print the modified array excluding the mode\'s value.

**Notice: You have to implement** `modify_array()` **based on the
provided** `main()`**, please read** `main()` **carefully ;).**

</div>

### Input

給定一陣列，第一個元素為改動模式的數值。 Given an array, the first
element is the mode\'s value.

### Output

改動後陣列的內容（不包含「模式」的值）。 The modified array excluding
the mode\'s value.

Shin\'s Attacking Zone
----------------------

### Description

<div>

As the leader of the 86 spearhead squadron, Shin\'s main job is to guide
the squadron members to the right place. He will receive the coordinates
of the enemies from the handler during the mission, all he has to do is
convert the coordinates into directions and distances that will become
the instructions of the squadron members.

![](https://c.tenor.com/Z34tCoScISsAAAAC/86anime-eighty-six.gif)

</div>

### Input

First line contains an integer N which indicates the number of the
enemies. Next, follows a list of coordinates (x, y) of the enemies,
where each coordinate of an enemy occupies a line. 1 \<= N \<= 1024
-1000 \<= x, y \<= 1000, where origin is (0, 0)

### Output

N lines of the direction DIR and the distance DIST of enemies where the
direction comes first followed by the distance and closed by a newline
character. 0 \<= DIR \<360, where 0 represents the positive x axis and
increases through counterclockwise. Both DIR and DIST should be rounded
to the hundredths.

Spread the Color
----------------

### Description

<div>

Read a graph with size `M(5) * N(8)`, for each pixel there are **3
colors(Red, Green, Blue)** that we respectively use `R`, `G`, `B` to
represent. If the pixel is **empty**, we use `X` to represent. After
reading the graph, read `row` and `col` to get the color of
`graph[row][col]`.Now, you need to spread the color starting from the
position `(row, col)` and finally print out the result. The spreading
rules are below:

**Spread color** `graph[row][col]` **starting from** `(row, col)`**in 4
directions(Up, Down, Left, Right).** You will encounter three
situations.\
1. Pixel\'s color is `X`: Fill the color with `graph[row][col]` and go
on.\
2. Pixel\'s color is the same as `graph[row][col]`: Go on.\
3. Pixel\'s color is different from `graph[row][col]`: Stop spreading.

### **Hint: See two-dimensional array as one-dimensional array.**

Given `char *p = &graph[0][0]`, you can use `*(p+row*N+col)` to visit
the element in `graph[row][col]`.

</div>

### Input

Input a is a pointer which indicates graph\[0\]\[0\], row and col are
int that indicate the starting position for spreading.

### Output

Your function needs to change the colors for each pixel in the graph
after spreading.

阿抄的小聰明 - David\'s Petty Tricks
------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

阿抄身為一個開明且優秀的教師，不會做一些對學生學習沒有益處的事，例如公開成績時他從不將學生的成績排序。－－至少表面上是。

今天，阿抄終於忍不住了決定好好的排一下，看看到底學生們到底做的多糟，\
然而，阿抄用陣列儲存學生的原始成績資料的資料庫都是公開的，突然排序勢必引起軒然大波，\
聰明的他想到：『只要我把記憶體位址拿來排序另外儲存，大家就只會看到奇怪的資料了，我真棒。』

問題是，雖然阿抄能夠寫出檢測用的程式，卻沒辦法寫出這個偷偷排序的函式（對，邏輯一點問題都沒有），\
請幫幫阿抄完成，維護他的表面吧。

### Problem Requirement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
請仔細觀察 Loader
Code，**設計出可以通過**`main()`**中各個檢測的函式**`sort_pointer()`。註解中會告訴你各個測試的檢測對象。\
Please carefully read the loader code, **design the
function**`sort_pointer()`**so that all tests in**`main()`**are
passed**. Purpose of each tests are written in the comments.\

### The \"Address of every`arr[]`entries appears in`ptr_arr[]`\" Check

-   此檢查用來確定`arr[0]`\~`arr[n]`的位址都有出現在`ptr_arr[]`中一次且僅有一次。\
    The verifies that the addresses of`arr[0]`\~`arr[n]`appears
    in`ptr_arr[]`once and only once.

<!-- -->

-   以
    [XOR-sum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17284337/what-is-an-xor-sum)
    來執行 [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum)
    的方式檢查，有興趣可以點開連結閱讀。\
    Performing [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) with
    the
    [XOR-sum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17284337/what-is-an-xor-sum)
    method to verify. You can read about it by clicking into the links.\

### **void** sort\_pointer**(int \*\***ptr\_arr**, int \***arr**, int** size**)**

-   **由大到小**排序指向`arr[]`之中各個元素的指標，存入`ptr_arr`之中。\
    Sort the values within`arr[]`in **descending order**, and store the
    pointer of the elements into`ptr_arr`.

-   你**不應該**對`arr`做出任何的改動。\
    You **should not** make any change to`arr`.

### Judging

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  本題的評分方法較為特殊，**你不需要自己撰寫任何關於輸出的程式碼**，而是觀察
    main function 的動作，補完程式碼並讓程式正確執行。\
    This is a custom judge problem. **You don\'t need to write any
    program outputting text**, finish the program so that the main
    function can be executed successfully.

2.  `assert()`這個 macro
    在**括號中的值為**`false`**時會報錯並直接結束程式**。你需要讓程式完整執行完才能獲得分數。\
    **When the expression with the parenthesis of the
    macro**`assert()`**evaluates to**`false`**, the program will raise
    an error and shut-down itself.** You must let the program fully
    execute in order to get the points.

### Trivia

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  `<type> **ptr` 等，稱作 **Pointer-to-Pointer**，而[不是 Double
    Pointer]{.underline}。

    Things like `<type> **ptr`, are called **Pointer-to-Pointer**, [not
    Double Pointer.]{.underline}

2.  兩個 pointer
    相減，得到的差的型態其實是`ptrdiff_t`而不是`int`，其定義於`<stddef.h>`中。\
    The result when subtracting two pointers actually has a type
    of`ptrdiff_t`, not`int`, defined in`<stddef.h>`.

</div>

### Input

The 1st line is a integer N, indicating how many entries are in the
array. 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 The 2nd line lists the entries of the array, starting
from index 0. All numbers appearing in the array are within the range
\[1, 1000\].

### Output

The program should successfully execute, Printing a single line of
string, \"All test passed successfully! :)\"

Big Big Numbers Addition
------------------------

### Description

<div>

You might know that computer can only represent a limited range of
numbers. For a 32-bit machine, it can only deal with signed integers
within \[-2147483648, 2147483647\]. But is there no any other way for
computers to deal with a number out of this range, for real?

Recall your memory in elementary school, how do you perform an addition?
Everyone might know this way:

      1234
    +  456
    -------
      1690

You take digits at same position, add them together. If the result is
bigger than 9, carry 1 into next round. Repeat these step until last
digit is processed.

If we use string to represent an integer, and use the addition process
above to calculate, digits by digits, then there will be no range
problem.

Now, given two VERY LARGE positive integers, can you add them together?

大家應該都知道，電腦能夠表示的數值範圍是非常有限的。一台 32
位元的電腦，最多只能表達在 \[-2147483648 - 2147483647\]
這個範圍內的有號整數而已。但難道真的沒有任何辦法能讓電腦進行超過這個範圍的整數運算嗎？

回想看看你在小學學算術時，你是怎麼進行加法的？我猜大家都學過直式加法，像是：

      1234
    +  456
    -------
      1690

這樣，把在同一個位數的位元相加，如果結果大於 9，就進 1
到下一位數去。重複這個步驟直到最左邊的數字計算完畢。

如果我們能用字串的方式來表示整數，然後用這個方法將他們一位一位相加，那就不會有超出範圍無法計算的問題了。

現在，給定你兩個**超大**的正整數，你能把他們加起來嗎？

</div>

### Input

The arguments passed to your function will be two strings a and b,
representing the VERY LARGE integers. The maximum length of these
strings do not exceed 100.

### Output

You have to put the result of a + b into argument res. We guarantee that
there will be enough space to hold the result of addition.

Game Patapon
------------

### Description

<div>

Patapon 是一款音樂節奏遊戲，你必須跟著節奏輸入指定的動作，才能打倒怪物！

在本題中有三種合法節奏（也就是接下來所謂的「指令」）：

PATA PATA PATA PON：可以前進一步。

PON PON PATA PON：可以原地攻擊怪物，扣除怪獸一滴血。

CHAKA CHAKA PATA PON：可以後退一步並防禦怪物攻擊。

以下有幾個注意事項：

當距離怪物超過 3 時，無論如何攻擊都攻擊不到怪物；但若跟怪物距離為 0
時，會直接被怪物踩爛死掉。

遊戲時可能會打錯遊戲指令，在這題也是，當出現不合法動作（例如：CHAKA
CHAKA PON PON），會直接被忽略。

每當做十個動作「後」（無論是否為合法動作），怪物會進行一次攻擊，如果攻擊前的該動作並非防禦（也就是
CHAKA CHAKA PATA PON），會直接被怪物打敗然後死掉。

但若在怪物攻擊前將怪物血量打至零，算成功打敗怪物。

每次最多進行三十次動作，請將每次遊戲進行的結果印出！（參考下方 I/O
說明）

Patapon is a music game, you have to follow the rhythm and enter the
commands to beat out the monster!

There are three kinds of valid rhythm (or we say 「command」 below):

PATA PATA PATA PON: move one step forward

PON PON PATA PON：no move and attack on the monster (one blood)

CHAKA CHAKA PATA PON：move one step backward and defend the monster\'s
attack

Notices:

When the distance between you and the monster is bigger than 3, you can
never attack on the monster.

But if the distance is 0, the monster will trample on you, and you will
die.

Sometimes there are some wrong commands, for example, CHAKA CHAKA PON
PON, those commands will be ignored with no effect.

After entering ten commands (no matter the command is valid or not), the
monster will attack on you.

If the command before the monster\'s attack is not the defence (i.e.
CHAKA CHAKA PATA PON), you will be attacked and die.

But, if the monster\'s blood is 0 before the monster attacks on you,
then it means you beat out the monster.

There are at most 30 commands in one round, please print out the result
of the game! (See I/O description)

### Input

一開始給兩個數字，分別為「與怪獸的距離」和「怪獸的血量」。
接著給予一字串，分別是每個動作指令，並以 . 或 , 隔開，最後會有一換行。
There are two numbers, the first one is 「the distance to the monster」,
and the second one is 「the monster\'s bloods」 Then, given a string
that contains commands separated by \'.\' or \',\'. Followed by a
newline.

### Output

若成功打敗怪物，印出 \"YES\"
以及一空格，最後印出遊戲中打敗怪物前「合法指令」的數量。
反之，若失敗（包含玩家死掉或指令輸完但怪物沒死），印出 \"NO\"
以及一空格，最後印出遊戲中怪物剩餘的血量。 If you beat out the monster
successfully, print out \"YES\" and one space, then print out the count
of 「the valid commands」 before beating out the monster. On the
contrary, if failed (e.g. you died or the commands end before beating
out the monster), print out \"NO\" and one space, then print out the
remaining bloods of the monster.

Rising Hope
-----------

### Description

<div>

Divination is a traditional way to predict future. Now given a string
`R` as the result of a magician doing some divination, please calculate
the \"Hope point\" from this string.

Hope points starts from `0`, you should scan result string from start to
end, if the character is `P`(Positive), means the hope is rising by 1

if the character is `N`(negative), means the hope point is decreased by
1.

0 \<= length of `R` \<= 1000

`R` may contain every upper case letters.

占卜是一種傳統的預測未來手段，
不論是把龜殼拿去火烤，觀察茶葉渣，請水晶球幫你看透真相（有時候是看透程式碼的bug）或是一群人聚在一起跳奇怪的舞蹈都是占卜手段。今天你得到一個字串
`R`， 代表占卜的結果，請你以這個字串計算『希望值』(Hope point)

希望值一開始為 0，若占卜結果中包含`P`(Positive)就會上升1,
包含`N`(negative)則會下降1

0 \<=`R` 的長度 \<= 1000

`R` 可能包含所有大寫字母

Sorting Student Name
--------------------

### Description

<div>

你還記得 [PK 學園轉學生](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/QJd9kELj6SEL)
嗎？

來了一個轉學生，表示班上有很多同學的座號需要被改變，座號的排序規則為：

\- 從名字拼音的開始排序，比較接近 `a` 的座號會比較前面

\- 大小寫字母沒有分別 (ex. `AMY` 與 `amy` 視作完全相同)

\-
如果剛好出現兩個班上學生姓名的前面字母完全相等，則名字較短的座號會比較前面。
(ex. `Sam` 與 `Samuel`， `Sam` 的座號會比較小)

請你 **按照座號**，印出所有班上學生的名稱！

\-\-\--

Do you remember [PK high school transfer
student](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/QJd9kELj6SEL)?

The sorting rules of student number are listed below:

\- Sorted by the letter of name, if the letter is closer to `A`, the
student number is smaller. (For instance, the student number of `Chloe`
is smaller than that of `Sam` because compare with `C` and `S`,`C` is
closer to `A`)

\- It is no different between lowercase and uppercase (ex. `AMY` and
`amy` are the same)

\- In this case, `Sam` and `Samuel`, the letters of `Sam` is the same as
the first three letters of `Samuel`, but the length of `Sam` is shorter
than that of `Samuel`, `Sam`\'s student number is smaller than Samuel.

Please base on the student number, print the name of all students in
this class!

</div>

### Input

First line is a number (N) represents for how many students are there in
the class. Following strings are the students\' names. 2 \<= N \<= 100 2
\<= length of students\' names \<= 100

### Output

Sorted students\' names.

Sei\'s online potion store
--------------------------

### Description

<div>

Sei is a researcher at the Medicinal Flora Research Institute. She has
been work there for a year and is struggling to improve her KPI. One day
she finds out that she can sell potions online to improve her poor KPI
(?. After several days of hard working, she has finished a framework of
the ordering system, there are only two little functions that aims to
calculate the total cost of orders and reordering the orders gaps her
from finish, please help her to fulfill those functions.

She currently sells 15 potion products over the online shop that are
given name `Prod_A, Prod_B ..., Prod_O`, each product costs differently,
the information could be found in the finished part (loader code) of the
platform. You do not need to concern the orders with the same pick up
time.![](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a527a758b1d7ad5b066382dd1e879acb/da9735baa45d502a-9e/s400x600/39963fb633c270428befd5937883837e6ae46561.gifv)

</div>

### Input

The first line contains an integer N that indicates the number of orders
which followed by the detail of N orders. For each order, the order ID
comes first, then the pick up time of the order which followed by the
item count M of the order, finally M items and the count are given.

### Output

The order ID and the total cost of the orders, the order that has a
closer pick up time comes first.

### Description

<div>

In lab, students buy snacks once a month. They want to choose snacks
with good value for money. (物超所值)

The `value` means `weight/price`.

Please help them sort snacks in descending order based on snacks\'
`value`.\
If the `value` of snacks are equal, sort snacks in ascending order based
on snacks\' `price`.\
If the `price` of snacks are equal, sort snacks in ascending order based
on snacks\' `id`.

You can use C standard library\'s `qsort` function to sort snacks:

`void qsort (void* base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void*,const void*));`

Weighted Score
--------------

### Description

<div>

期末快到了，該到結算成績的時候，請你幫助教算出所有學生們的期末成績以及最高分章節成績與最低分章節。\
在這裡有三個 struct:

-   `weight` : 每個章節會有不同的比重，**全部的比重加起來為 100**

-   `score` : 每個章節加權前的分數

-   `report_card` :

    -   `final` : 加權後的分數 (無條件捨去到整數位)

    -   `max_score` : 最高分章節成績

    -   `min_score` : 最低分章節成績

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please help TAs to calculate student's final score, maximum score and
minimum score.

There are three structs:

-   `weight` : Each chapter contain different weight, **sum of them is
    100**.

-   `score` : The score of each chapter

-   `report_card` :

    -   `final` : Score after weighting

    -   `max_score` : Maximum score

    -   `min_score` : Minimum score

</div>

### Input

First line contain two numbers: chapter\_num (n), student\_num (m) 1 \<=
chapter\_num (n) \<= 10 1 \<= student\_num (m) \<= 100 Each of following
n lines contain one number and a string. The number means the weight of
chapter. The string means the name of chapter. Followings are the
student information. First line is student name. Next n lines are
student score and chapter. 0 \<= student score \<= 100

windowlocation
--------------

### Description

<div>

在 Chrome 瀏覽器內按下 F12，會打開瀏覽器的開發者工具。在 console
當中輸入 `window.location`，會看到一個叫作 `Location`
的結構跑出來，上頭記載了你當前所在的網址所包含的資訊，包含：

-   通訊協定 (protocol)

-   主機名稱 (host)

-   通訊埠 (port)

-   所在路徑 (pathname)

-   查詢字串/Query String (search)

-   識別符號 (hash)

那麼，這些不同的部份是怎麼被切出來的呢？其實網址是有固定格式的，就跟你家的門牌號碼一樣。網址的格式為：

`[通訊協定]://[主機名稱]:[通訊埠]/[所在路徑]?[查詢字串]#[識別符號]`

舉例，`https://www.abc.com/user/12345/photo?from=20180101&to=20201231#favorite`可以被切成：

-   通訊協定 = `https`

-   主機名稱 = `www.abc.com`

-   通訊埠 = 預設不顯示（但因為使用的是 https，所以可知是 443）

-   所在路徑 = `/user/12345/photo`

-   查詢字串 = `?from=20180101&to=20201231`

-   識別符號 = `#favorite`

但也並非所有部份都位同時存在於一個網址中，像是本頁面的網址就沒有查詢字串的部份。

現在，給你一些網址，請你幫忙找出上述的片段，並裝入 `Location` 結構當中。

</div>

### Input

An valid url. Must includes protocol and host part, but port, pathname,
search and hash are not necessarily existing.

### Output

You should put the information parsed from url into the struct passed by
argument. For information not existing in url, if it\'s an integer, set
to 0; if it\'s a string, make it an empty string. Hint: you should
prepare memory storage yourself.

The Sly TA and His Sly Gun
--------------------------

### Description

<div>

Chou is a secret agent of his country. One day, he is assigned a job to
find the stolen treasure of his country. To help him fulfill the job,
his boss gave him a weapon called SlyGun, as the name indicated, there
are two possible ways, front and back, for the gun to fire, and the
direction of the next fire will be decided by following process:

1.  SlyGun will be assigned a floating point number

2.  The given floating number will be divided into 4 bytes

3.  Treat the 4 bytes as unsigned characters and sum them up into an
    unsigned character

4.  The SlyGun will fire forward if the sum of 4 bytes is even,
    backward, otherwise

HAPPY PARTY TRAIN
-----------------

### Description

<div>

One tourist train is departing, and it\'s powered by a steam locomotive.

Unfortunately, when passengers holding a party in cars,

the coal used as fuel in the back of the locomotive is on fire, burning
red.

And every car contains different number of flammable items.

When passengers see the fire coming, they try to move these items to
prevent fire burn to their car.

If number of peoples in the car \>= amounts of flammable items, fire
will not burn to this car and the following cars.

Otherwise, passengers in this car will evacuate to the the next car.

Now you know the number of people & flammable items in each car,

Please calculate how many cars will be burnt by fire.

This train is represented with linked-list，each `Car` node\'s `next`
will point to the next car，last cat will points to `NULL`

一列鐵道觀光專車在春天來臨的花香中，乘著無盡想像發車了

為了為乘客們帶來種種回憶，主辦單位特別使用蒸氣火車頭牽引這列專車

很不幸的，乘客們正在車廂中開派對時，車頭後作為燃料的煤炭起火了，正發出熊熊火光

而後方每節車廂中都有數量不等的易燃物

當大家發現火災發生時，便試著將易燃物搬開來避免火勢延燒

若該節車廂人數 \>=
易燃物數量時，火勢便會停止蔓延，不會延燒到該節和後續的車廂

但若人數不足，則車廂中所有人都會移往下一節車廂逃生

直到延燒停止或所有乘客無處可逃並跳車為止。

你已知的有每節車廂中的人數及易燃物數量

請計算火勢總共會延燒幾節車廂？

這列火車以 linked-list 形式紀錄，每個 `Car` 節點的 `next`
會指向下一節車廂，最後一節車廂則指向 `NULL`\

Stack
-----

### Description

<div>

Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements,
with two main principal operations:

1.  Push: which adds an element to the top of the stack

2.  Pop: which removes an element from the top of the stack if the stack
    is not empty

![Image](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_representation.jpg)

Please implement push and pop operations of the stack using linked list.

Reference:
<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/stack_algorithm.htm>

</div>

### Input

The input contains two parts. The first part is the number of the
operations. The second part contains the content of the operations,
which is push or pop an integer to/from the stack.

### Output

The output contains two lines. The first line is the size of the stack,
and the second line consists of elements\' data and each data is
followed by a space. You should output them in reverse chronological
order.

法陣模擬器 - The Magic Circle Simulator
---------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

> **01/09 Update：在圖例中各色晶球右上方新增文字標示。**

本學期陪伴著大家的阿超，其實一直都在學習著魔法。\
而他所學習的，是由蘊含力量的『晶球 (Orbs)』組成『魔法陣 (Magic
Circle)』後來施放的。\
將各種不同的晶球置入後會引發各種不同的反應，最終生成一個可以協助施法的魔法陣。

\
就跟學習寫程式一樣，施放魔法也需要不停的練習才能專精；\
但阿超遇到了一個問題：晶球**很貴**。置入後又拿不回來，可經不起他隨意亂試亂浪費。\
於是他打算以程式來模擬放置晶球後的魔法陣的結果，來節省他得來不易的辛苦錢。

###  The Magic Circle

一個完整的魔法陣由以下兩個部分組成：

-   中心圓環，稱作『根』(Root)，**只能放置下方說明的普通晶球**

    -   將其中一個編號為 0，下方圖例為 12 點鐘方向。

-   自中心圓環連接出的的晶球列，稱作『枝』(Stem)，能放置任意晶球

    -   以根部的各晶球為首只能形成單一路徑，不能有圓環、分支。

    -   放置晶球時，必須自編號為 0
        的根部開始依順時針擺放，不論發生什麼反應。

以下是一個簡單範例，球中的數字標示放置的順序：

![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec17/%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A3%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%99%A8%20-%20The%20Magic%20Circle%20Simulator/images/6d03f52f4b5c5f09f78965424672d48ad13a914c.png)

### Orbs

晶球名稱後方的括弧內的大寫英文字母，代表在 input 中對應的字元。\

**Red Orb (R) / Blue Orb (B) / Green Orb (G) / Yellow Orb (Y) /**

-   四種顏色的**普通晶球**，放置時不會產生任何反應。\

**\
漂浮晶球 Floater Orb (F)**

-   放置時不產生反應。

-   在同一個 Stem 上這個晶球後被置入的晶球，皆會被移動至該 Stem
    的第一個位置。

-   同一個 Stem
    上只可以有一個漂浮晶球，當置入第二個時該晶球會馬上消失，不對魔法陣做出任何改變。

-   **[所有其他晶球的反應皆會在漂浮反應後發生]{.underline}**[。]{.underline}

-   以下為在某 Stem 上以 `Y R F G B F G` 的順序置入晶球的範例：\
    [\
    ]{.underline}![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec17/%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A3%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%99%A8%20-%20The%20Magic%20Circle%20Simulator/images/20dcfe2be0e95816633cfd84b5324f765c9866cb.png)

**\
複製晶球 Cloning Orb (C)**

-   置入在 Stem s 之後，計算目前整個魔法陣上總共有幾個複製晶球，假設為 k
    個。

-   將自 s 的逆時針方向的第 k 個 Stem 的構成轉換為 s 的構成。

-   範例：

![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec17/%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A3%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%99%A8%20-%20The%20Magic%20Circle%20Simulator/images/ec95bd2633f20d77028a50fc245ede075b4861f4.png)

**\
擴展晶球 Expand Orb (E)**

-   置入 Stem s 之後，生成與 s 根部相同的普通晶球置入魔法陣上的所有
    Stem。

-   範例：

![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec17/%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A3%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%99%A8%20-%20The%20Magic%20Circle%20Simulator/images/d44e02f6ce011e0ebff5292c157bb9850112d894.png)

**\
吸引晶球 Dyson Orb (D)**

-   置入 Stem s 之後，將 s 以外的魔法陣上所有跟 s
    的根相同的普通晶球吸引過來，一一置入。

-   範例:

![](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/Lec17/%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A3%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%99%A8%20-%20The%20Magic%20Circle%20Simulator/images/d517aa76699c4848372dca990e5f46d3cc810060.png)

### Program Requirement

仔細閱讀以上說明以及下方的 loader code，撰寫程式碼令 Loader
可成功印出阿超完成的魔法陣的構成。

`head_t` 中的 `count` 可以提供你紀錄任何整數資料，但你不一定需要使用。

</div>

### Input

The first line contains two integer \`size\` and \`k\` \`size\`
indicates the size of the center ring. \`k\` indicates how many orbs
will be placed into the magic circle by hand. 1 ≤ size ≤ 100 0 ≤ k ≤
200; The Second Line contains \`size\` characters, Shows the
configuration of the center ring, starting from index 0. The Third Line
contains \`k\` characters, Shows the order to insert the orbs. The
available characters are \'R\' / \'G\' / \'B\' / \'Y\' / \'C\' / \'D\' /
\'E\' / \'F\'.

### Output

Print the final configuration of the magic circle. From index 0, print
the root at form \"CO\_X\", then chain \" -\> X\" To show the stem.
nothing should appear after \"CO\_X\" If the stem is empty The function
print\_magic\_circle() is already finished, you don\'t need to implement
it, but make sure your data is represented correctly for it to run.

### Description

**UPDATE !!**

由於有同學反應在 windows 電腦上面的 clion 無法正常執行 loader code
內容，

所以更新 loader code ，

請注意讀取時與 bingo function 的參數資料型態。

------------------------------------------------------------------------

大家都玩過賓果吧！\
以下是 4 \* 4 的範例：

1 0 1 **1**\
0 0 **1** **1**\
0 **1** 0 **1**\
**1** 0 1 **1**

可以看到有一條直的，一條斜的，總共兩條連線。

為了環保愛地球，一個 `n * n` 的賓果使用 `n * n`
大小的空間實在太浪費了！\
聰明的 Amy 想到，在電腦中，所有的變數背後都是 0 或
1，那我們可以使用一些數字來替代這張表格，減少使用的空間。

舉例來說，把這些 0 與 1 視作二進制的表示方式，並把他轉化為十進制

`1 0 1 1` -\> 2\^3 + 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `11`\
`0 0 1 1` -\> 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `3`\
`0 1 0 1` -\> 2\^2 + 2\^0 = `5`\
`1 0 1 1` -\> 2\^3 + 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `11`

所以我們可以使用 `11 3 5 11` 來表示上圖的表格。

在這裡，我們要玩的是進階版賓果！\
題目會給出 8 個 8 bits 的數字來表示 `8*8`
大小的表格，請你算出當中會有幾條連線

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is 4 \* 4 sample:

1 0 1 **1**\
0 0 **1** **1**\
0 **1** 0 **1**\
**1** 0 1 **1**

There are two lines above, vertical and diagonal.

It's wasteful to use `n * n` space to play `n * n` bingo.\
As every number is stored as 0 or 1 in computer, we can use some other
numbers to represent that table.

For example, those 0 and 1 can be regarded as binary, and we can convert
it into decimal.

`1 0 1 1` -\> 2\^3 + 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `11`\
`0 0 1 1` -\> 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `3`\
`0 1 0 1` -\> 2\^2 + 2\^0 = `5`\
`1 0 1 1` -\> 2\^3 + 2\^1 + 2\^0 = `11`

So the above bingo can be represented as `11 3 5 11`.

Here we are going to play `8 * 8` bingo.\
Eight 8 bits numbers are provided to represent the `8 * 8` bingo. Please
count how many lines are in the bingo.

Find Maximum Fruit Number
-------------------------

### Description

<div>

`-英文題目-`

Given a sequence (char input\[\]), there are many fruits in this
sequence. (at most 20 kinds of fruit)

The fruits are connected with +\_+ symbol.

Please output every fruit which has the maximum number of
**occurrence.**

If there are many fruits which have the same maximum number of
occurrence, follow char fruit\[\]\[15\]\'s order.

`hint: answer can more than one fruit`

`-中文題目-`

給定一個 sequence，

該 sequence 包含很多種水果(最多會出現20種水果)，

並且每種水果以 +\_+ 符號隔開，

其中這20種可能出現的水果已經定義在 Loader，

也傳入 find\_fruit() (等同於 char fruit\[\]\[15\])，

例如: fruit\[0\] 代表第一種水果, fruit\[1\]代表第二種水果等等，

請將所有出現最多次的水果都印出來

`如果有相同出現次數的水果，順序請依照 char fruit[][15] 中的順序，例如優先印出 guava 再來 litchi`

相同次數印出的先後順序:

guava\>litchi\>longan\>watermelon\>pomelo\>pear\>banana\>papaya\>pumpkin\>tomato\>mango\>kiwi\>persimmon\>cantaloupe\>strawberry\>grape\>peach\>orange\>coconut\>lemon

`提示: 出現最多次的水果可能不只一種`

`提示: 請務必仔細閱讀 Loader code，來弄清楚整個程式的架構`

`hint: strtok()`

</div>

### Input

There is one line for the sequence (char input\[\]) and has at most
20000 char. The fruits are connected with +\_+ in this sequence (at
least one fruit in this sequence).

### Output

Output the fruit which has the maximum number of occurrence. (you need
to print \"\\n\" at the end of each line)。
如果有相同出現次數的水果，順序請依照 char fruit\[\]\[15\]
中的順序，例如優先印出 guava 再來 litchi 等等

Happy Happy Warehouse Manager
-----------------------------

### Description

<div>

Mr. Huang is a worker who works in a warehouse. He loves to stake things
up to build a tower, Every time the factory sends him newly manufactured
goods, he will stack them on the top of his tower. Once a shop asking
for goods, the goods that are on the top of the tower will be sent out
first. After a busy day, goods on that tower may change a lot, which
left him a difficult job to record. Now, you are asked to help him to
maintain his happy tower.

There are three kinds of goods: `Juice`, `Wine` and `Laptop`. (I know
that stacking laptop with drinks is a bad idea, but Mr. Huang loves to
do that\...) These are defined in the loader.

Then you will receive a list of records that represents what happened
today, the record looks like:

`Produce Juice 5`, this means that factory sends Mr. Huang 5 boxes of
juice.

`Consume 7`, means a shop asking for 7 boxes of goods (You don\'t need
to concern what is in those box, just send them out).

After a busy day, you have to list the things left on the tower from the
top.

`Hint`: You may implement using linked list to maintain that stack.

黃桑是一個快樂的倉儲工，他最喜歡把所有的東西都疊成高高塔。當工廠送來了新的貨物，他都會將他們疊到他的高塔上，而當有商店要批貨時，他也會直接將高塔頂端的貨物寄出去給他們。由於業務繁忙，因此每天高塔上的貨物變動會很大，這會讓每天的結算變得非常麻煩，現在要麻煩你替他設計一個倉儲系統，幫幫黃桑統計每天的貨物吧\~!

黃桑經手的貨物總共有三種:
`果汁`、`紅酒`跟`筆記型電腦`。(我知道把這些東西疊在一起不是個好主意，但親愛的黃先生喜歡\.....)詳細的定義請見Loader。

每天結束後，你都會從黃桑那拿到一張記滿當日進出貨物的紀錄，紀錄長得像這樣:

`Produce Juice 5`, 代表工廠送來了5箱果汁。

`Consume 7`,
代表有商店批了7箱貨(你不需要在意箱子裡裝的是甚麼東西，把東西送出去就對了)。

當你統計完之後，請將塔上剩餘的東西從上至下列出。

`系統提示`: 或許你可以用linked list 的方式在你的電腦中蓋出虛擬的高塔。

</div>

### Input

A list of records with EOF terminated. Hint: To generate EOF manually
while you are testing your code locally, press ctrl+Z on windows and
ctrl+D on linux.

### Output

A list of remained goods from top to bottom. The output format is:
\"Good\_type x remain\_count\" follows a newline character. If the tower
is empty, you need to print \"Empty\" followed by a newline character.

Rearrange Chatting History
--------------------------

### Description

<div>

Nowadays, \"LINE\" is a well known communication application. \"LINE\"
provides a feature that you can store your chatting history into text
files(`.txt`). Unfortunately, you get a text file with incorrect order.
Therefore, your task is to rearrange the chatting history into the
ascending order with timestamp (**00:00 - 23:59**). Assume that at most
one message per minute and the history is always on the same day.

現今，\"LINE\"是個知名的通訊應用程式。"
LINE"提供了一項功能，你可以將聊天記錄存儲到文本文件(`.txt`)中。很不幸的是，你拿到了一份錯誤順序的文本文件。因此，你的任務就是將聊天紀錄依照時間升序(**00:00
- 23:59**)重新排序。假設每分鐘最多只有一則訊息且記錄一定都是在同一天。

</div>

### Input

First line is the total message (\<= 100). Then, the followings are the
each message information separated by newline with the format:
hour:miniute name content.

### Output

All message information in correct order with the format same as Input.

The puzzle is represented using a 9 by 9 structure array
(`struct element grid[9][9]`), and each element\'s `num` is an integer
between 0\~9 (**0 means there is no value yet, corresponding to the
white area in the figure, and** `can_modify` **is set to true**). **The
elements that you should not change are the gray shaded area in the
figure** and they belong to this problem (`can_modify` **is set to
false**).

Implement the `solve()` function that can automatically solve a given
sudoku puzzle (you should directly modify `grid[9][9]` and fill in the
correct answer).

Note: There is exactly one solution for each testcase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

數獨是一個邏輯和數字組合的遊戲。其目標是將數字填入 9x9
的格子內，並使其每一行，列，和 3x3 的格子皆由 1～9 的數字所組成。

例如：如上圖

本次題目中，數獨由一個 9x9 的 struct array 表示
(`struct element grid[9][9]`)，而每個 element 的 `num` 為介於 0\~9 的
integer (0 表示還沒有填入任何數字，且其 `can_modify` 設為
true)。不應更改圖中灰色區域的格子，這些格子為題目 (`can_modify` 設為
false)。

實作 `solve()` 函數來自動解出給定的數獨 (直接修改 `grid[9][9]` 即可)。

註：每個測資都會是唯一解。

Calculating Volume
------------------

### Description

<div>

Read an integer `mode`, you need to calculate the volume for the mode.
In different modes, you need to read different number of double
precision floating-points and then print out the volume that is rounded
to 2 decimal places. The followings are 4 modes:

1.  Mode 1:\
    In this mode, you need to `scanf` **a double precision
    floating-point which represents the length of cube(立方體)**.\
    **volume = length \* length \* length.**

2.  Mode 2:\
    In this mode, you need to `scanf` **three double precision
    floating-points which sequentially represent length, width and
    height of cuboid(長方體)**.\
    **volume = length \*** ** **width \* height.**

3.  Mode 3:\
    In this mode, you need to `scanf` **two double precision
    floating-points which sequentially(依序) represents the radius and
    height of cylinder(圓柱體)**.\
    **volume = 3.14 \* radius \* radius \* height.**

4.  Mode 4:\
    In this mode, you need to `scanf` **an double precision
    floating-point which represents the length of

Given 1 \<= `mode`\<= 4, each double precision floating-point is in
range 1 \~ 100

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Hint**:

1.  You can use the **sqrt()** and **pow()** function by using the
    following preprocessor directive:\
    `#include <math.h>`

2.  All the values should be double precision floating-point, including
    **PI(3.14)**.

讀入一個整數
`mode`，你必須計算該模式下的體積。在不同模式中，你必須要能讀入不同個數的雙精度浮點數(double)並且印出體積(四捨五入至小數點後第2位)。以下為4種模式
:

1.  模式 1:\
    在模式 1 中，你必須 `scanf`
    **一個雙精度浮點數代表立方體的長度(length)**。\
    **立方體體積 = 長度 \* 長度 \* 長度。**

2.  模式 2:\
    在模式 2 中，你必須 `scanf`
    **三個雙精度浮點數依序代表長方體的長(length)、寬(width)、高(height)**。\
    **長方體體積 = 長 \* 寬 \* 高**。

3.  模式 3:\
    在模式 3 中，你必須 `scanf`
    **兩個雙精度浮點數依序代表圓柱體的半徑(radius)、高(height)**。\
    **圓柱體體積 = 3.14 \* 半徑 \* 半徑 \* 高**。

4.  模式 4:\
    在模式 4 中，你必須 `scanf`
    **一個雙精度浮點數代表四面體的長度(length)**。\
    **四面體體積 = √2 / 12 \* 長度 \* 長度 \* 長度**。

給定 1 \<= `mode` \<= 4 且每個雙精度浮點數的範圍會在 1 \~ 100。

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**提示:**

你可以藉由使用`#include<math.h>` 來呼叫函式 **sqrt()** 和 **pow()**。

所有的值都必須使用雙精度浮點數來計算，包含**PI(3.14)**。

Department Store Anniversary
----------------------------

### Description

<div>

The NCKU department store is having an anniversary sale. Customers can
get free gift if they spend more than \$100. On the 8th floor, people
line up in rows of two in front of the customer service counter to get
their gift. Suddenly, one of the desk goes out of service, so customers
in front of this desk must merge into the other line. For the sake of
fairness, staffs need to help people to line up in one line **in the
order of their arrival**. Luckily, you are the one who remember the
order of everyone\'s arrival. (what a reliable staff, huh?) Can you
decide the final order of the new line?

成大百貨公司正在舉辦周年慶，消費滿 100
元即可兌換滿額贈禮。顧客們紛紛擠上八樓，兩個服務台都排滿了長長的隊伍。突然間，其中一個服務台的機器故障了，前方的人龍通通得合併到正常運作的服務台前的隊伍。為了確保先到的人都能先領到禮品，合併後的隊伍順序必須要是**顧客抵達八樓的順序**才行。還好，你就是那個記得所有顧客的抵達順序的員工（真厲害）。你能協助其它員工一起安排隊伍嗎？

</div>

### Input

The input consists of 3 lines. The first line contains 2 integers m, n.
Each line indicates the number of people. And 10 \<= m, n \<= 1000. The
second line is an array of integers and its length is m. The third line
is an array of integers and its length is n. The numbers a\[ i \] in the
arrays indicate the order of arrival, and 1 \<= a\[ i \] \<= 10000.
Every number is unique, and may not be continuous.

### Output

Odd Magic Square
----------------

### Description

<div>

The **odd** magic square consists of consecutive integers (starting with
1 and ending with n²) placed into`n`rows by `n` columns.

The sum of each row, each column and each diagonal are the same.

**Hint:**

1.  Place number 1 in the middle of first row.

2.  Check if the **upper right** grid is empty:

-   if empty: fill the next number in this **upper right** grid

-   if not empty: fill the next number in the **bottom of current grid**

3.  Check if the last step **exceeds the boundary**, you need to return
    to the **other side**.

    You can see the following example to understand the process !

奇數魔方陣是指在`n`x`n`的方陣中，放入從1開始到n\^2的連續數字。

使每一行、每一列與每條對角線的和皆相同。

提示:

1.  首先在第一列的最中間那個方格填入1。

2.  接著檢查該方格的**右上方**是否為空的:

-   如果是空的: 將下個數字填入**右上方的方格**

-   如果不是空的: 將下個數字填入**當前方格的正下面那格**

3.  如果在上一步會**超出邊界**，則需要返回**另一邊**

    你可以看下方的範例來了解過程!

Rotate Image
------------

### Description

<div>

In computer, everything is represented by numbers --- so does image.
Computer stores image as a matrix. A cell in the matrix is a pixel in
the image, and number in the cell represents the color of that pixel.

If we want to rotate an image, it means that we want to rotate the
matrix itself. For example, consider an image as follows:

`| 1 2 3 |`\
`| 4 5 6 |`\
`| 7 8 9 |`

If we want to **rotate this image 90 degrees to the right**, we can
rotate the matrix like this:

`| 7 4 1 |`\
`| 8 5 2 |`\
`| 9 6 3 |`

Now given the degree of **right rotation**, can you help me rotate my
images?

在電腦裡，所有東西都是用數字來表達的------就連圖片也不例外。電腦以矩陣的形式來儲存每一張圖片，矩陣裡的格子代表著圖片的像素，而格子裡的數字就代表了該像素的顏色。

當我們要對圖片做旋轉時，我們實際上就是在旋轉這個矩陣本身。舉例來說，如果有一張圖片長這樣：

`| 1 2 3 |`\
`| 4 5 6 |`\
`| 7 8 9 |`

如果我們想將這張圖片**向右旋轉 90 度**，那麼就等於是把矩陣旋轉成這樣：

`| 7 4 1 |`\
`| 8 5 2 |`\
`| 9 6 3 |`

給定**向右旋轉的角度**，你能將圖片做正確的旋轉嗎？

</div>

### Input

The input consists of 3 part. The first line is an integer, indicates
the degree of right rotation. It will be one of the following numbers:
90, 180 or 270. The second line contains 2 integers m & n, indicates the
dimension of the image. And 3 \<= m, n \<= 100. The following m lines
contain n integers, representing the image itself. Each integer in the
image is in the range of \[0, 100\].

### Output

The rotated image. Each number must follow by a space. You need to print
newline at the end of last line.

Vigenère Cipher Encoder
-----------------------

### Description

<div>

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a
series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword.
In a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some
number of places. For example, in a Caesar cipher of shift 3, `A` would
become `D`, `b` would become `e`, `y` would become `b` and so on. The
Vigenère cipher has several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different
shift values, which are determined by a text string called \"key\". The
\"key\" only contains lowercase letters.

For example, let\'s assume the \"key\" is `abcde`. Each alphabet of the
\"key\" is converted to its corresponding numeric value (e.g.`a` = `0`,
`b` = `1`, \... `z` = `25`):

-   alphabet: `a b c d e`

<!-- -->

-   numeric value: `0 1 2 3 4`

To encrypt the message, say \"**TAs are so H4ND5OME.**\", we should
arrange the \"key\" as follows:

`a b c d e a b c d e a b c d`

`0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

We now shift each **alphabet** of the message (1.) by the numeric
\"key\" we arranged in the previous step (2.) to create ciphertext (3.)
as shown below:

1.  `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

2.  `0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

3.  `T B u d v e t q K R D P O H`

And the plaintext message \"**TAs are so H4ND5OME.**\" becomes \"**TBu
dve tq K4RD5POH.**\" in ciphertext.

Write a program that prints out the Vigenère cipher for the given input
(described in Input Format).

Note: Transform only English alphabet (case-preserving) and preserve
other characters such as Arabic numerals or punctuation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

維吉尼亞密碼是使用一系列凱薩密碼來加密文字的算法，透過一組密鑰來進行加密。在凱薩密碼中，每個英文字母都會偏移一個固定的數字。例如，在偏移量為3的凱薩密碼中，`A`
會變成 `D`，`b` 會變成 `e`，`y` 會變成
`b`，以此類推。維吉尼亞密碼則是由好幾組不同偏移量的凱薩密碼編排而成，透過一個稱為「密鑰」的字串來決定其偏移值。而這個密鑰僅包含小寫英文字母。

舉例來說，假設密鑰是 `abcde`。密鑰中的每個字母會轉為其對應的數字(例如
`a` = `0`, `b` = `1`, \... `z` = `25`)：

-   英文字母: `a b c d e`

<!-- -->

-   數字: `0 1 2 3 4`

要加密 \"**TAs are so H4ND5OME.**\" 這段訊息，我們要將密鑰如下排列：

`a b c d e a b c d e a b c d`

`0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

接著根據前一步驟排列的密鑰(2.)，對訊息中的每個**英文字母**(1.)做位移來產生加密的文字(3.)，如下：

1.  `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

2.  `0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3`

3.  `T B u d v e t q K R D P O H`

而這段純文字訊息 \"**TAs are so H4ND5OME.**\" 會變成 \"**TBu dve tq
K4RD5POH.**\"，即為加密後的訊息，意思是助教好帥 ;-)。

寫一個程式，根據給定的輸入來輸出對應的維吉尼亞加密。

註：只需轉換英文字母(保留大小寫)且保留其他字元例如阿拉伯數字或標點符號。

</div>

### Input

The input contains three lines. All of these lines are followed by a
newline character. The first line contains the length of the \"key\",

利姆路是隻可愛的始萊姆，雖然是它只是隻始萊姆，但它統領著森林中的魔物們。自古以來，魔物們最大的威脅莫過於人類的殺戮，利姆路為了保護它所管理的魔物們，它決定讓魔物們在村莊四周蓋上城牆，但是在它領導的眾多魔物村莊中，僅有部份村莊生產建造城牆所需的材料，因此其他村莊需要向這些村莊下訂這些材料。經過一年汲汲營營的建造，利姆路的辦公桌上積滿了來自各個村莊下訂建材的訂單，請你寫一個程式幫助它統整這些訂單。

在這題中，你僅需要完成程式的特定函式，在這個函式中，你會拿到**由訂單組成的
linked-list**，其中每筆訂單都會包含以下資訊：訂單的編號、下定的村莊、下定的建材編號以及數量。請注意：**建材數量的資訊被包裝在
union
中**，你必須根據建材編號讀取特定的欄位。你要實做的函式需要**替每個村莊收集屬於它的訂單**，並將它們串接成**獨立的
linked-list**，其中的訂單須按照**訂單編號由少至多**進行排序，並且，請替每個村莊**計算過去這年它共花了多少錢**購買建材（不同建材的單價可以在
loader code
中找到）。最後，為了簡化之後的查詢速度，請**將村莊按照名稱排列**。

Rimuru is a cute slime who was killed by a random murder in his previous
life, now he becomes the leader of the monsters live in the forest. To
help the monsters prevent threads from the human world, he plans to make
monsters build great walls around their villages. Since there are lots
of villages in his monster kingdom, and only several of them are able to
supply the building parts, they must trade those ingredients between the
villages. After a year went through, the orders between villages are
piled up like a mountain, please, help him to unify the orders.

In the following program, you will get **several orders constructed as a
linked-list**, each order contains following things: order id, consumer
of the order, the ingredient id and the amount of the ingredient. Please
notice that **the amount of the ingredient are packed in an union**, you
have to retrieve it from the specific member depends on the ingredient
id. For each village, your program should not only **gather the orders
belongs to it**, **reconstruct them into an independent linked-list**,
**sort the orders in ascending order by the order id**, but also
**calculate the total cost** of all orders (the unit cost of each
ingredient can be found in the loader program). Finally, your program
should **sort the result list of villages via their name**.

\[25 Points\] Order Recovery
----------------------------

### Description

<div>

小混蛋工廠最近遇到了大麻煩！

他們的系統不知道出了什麼問題，接收到的訂單可能會少字，並以奇怪的格式呈現。

請協助他們恢復訂單內容，並告訴他們該訂單要的貨到底是什麼！

舉例來說，當訂單收到的是 `ter:mel`，代表要的貨有兩個（以 `:`
隔開），其中一個包含字串 `ter`，另一個包含字串 `mel`。

然而，工廠內有太多東西了，以符合 `ter` 來說，可能是 `water`，可能是
`battery`，也可能是 `butter`。（沒錯，這間工廠什麼都有。）

因此小混蛋工廠的員工決定只選擇「最先符合該字串」的物品，當作客人要的貨，上述三項的話，將會選擇
`water` 當作結果。

（因為 `water`
是在第三個字母開始符合，其他兩者都是在第四個字母才開始符合。）

當然，若有兩個以上字串符合上述情況，則優先選擇字數最短的字串，字數相同時，則比較兩字串各字元，優先選擇字元較前面的字串。

例如：訂單要求 `ham`，則 `hammer` 和 `hamburger` 將選擇 `hammer`。

又例如：訂單要求 `yo`，則 `yolk` 和 `yoyo` 將選擇 `yolk`（因為順序上 `l`
比 `y` 前面）。

最後回到訂單的舉例，若 `ter` 選出的貨為 `water`，`mel` 選出的貨為
`melon`，則最後以 `+` 連結，輸出 `water+melon`。

另外，每張訂單最少有 1 樣物品，但最多不會超過 30 樣物品。

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bestards\' Factory has a big trouble!

Somewhere is wrong in their system, so the order they received may miss
some characters, and is showed in a strange way.

Please help them recover the order, and tell they what the customers
want.

For example, if the order\'s content is `ter:mel`, it means there are
two items（separated by `:`）, one includes substring `ter`, and the
other includes substring `mel`.

However, there are too many goods, we use `ter` as an example, it may be
`water`, `battery`, or `butter`. (Yah, the factory sells everything!)

Hence we choose the goods that 「is matched by the substring from the
more forward position」, as the goods that the customers want.

In the example, we will choose `water`. (Since `water` matches `ter`
from the third position, while the other two match from the fourth
position.)

If there are at least two goods meet the condition, then we choose the
string with shorter length.

If the length are the same, then compare two strings, and choose the one
that is less than the other.

For example, if `ham`, then `hammer` and `hamburger`, we choose
`hammer`.

Another example, if `yo`, then `yolk` and `yoyo`, we choose `yolk`.
(Since in ascii, `l` is prior to `y`.)

Back to the first example, if `ter` represents for `water`, and `mel`
represents for `melon`, then concatenate them by using `+` and print out
`water+melon` as the result.

Every order orders at least 1 goods, but won\'t exceed 30 goods.

</div>

### Input

輸入為一字串，其中以 \':\' 分隔訂單物品。 The input is a string, and the
goods are separated by \':\'.

司波達也是名魔法工程師，平常的工作是替客戶調校及改善魔法道具（想不到吧，魔法也跟程式一樣喔～），今天他接到了一個棘手的案子，不管用什麼方式都找不到
Bug
在哪裡，因此他決定直接把魔法道具的記憶體倒出來看看，請你幫他開寫一支程式來印出魔法道具的記憶體內容。

你的程式會得到兩個數字：stb 跟 num，其中 num 是長度固定為 8
位元組的數字，而 stb
代表司波想要檢測的記憶體內容的開頭。司波每次固定檢查從 stb 開始的 8
個位元，為了避免模糊焦點，請將不需要被檢測的記憶體內容設為 0。

Tatsuya is a magic engineer whose daily job is to calibrate and improve
the magic tools. One day he got sucked in a tricky job that an unknown
bug takes him a week and still no progress. To find out the mistake of
the magic program, he decides to dump the entire memory of the magic
tool, please help him to fulfill that.

Your program will recieve two integer: stb and num, where num is an
8-byte number, and stb indicates the begining bit that Tatsuya
interested in. Notice that only 8 bits will be checked each time, please
zero out the rest of bits to zero before print out the content.

\[30 Points\] Pull The Radish
-----------------------------

### Description

<div>

在開心農場裡，Ariel 種了 `N`
根蘿蔔，每個蘿蔔的間距為一公尺，今天是收成的日子，但 Ariel
不想要一次拔光所有蘿蔔，所以他決定以自己為起點 (起點為
`y`)，分別向左和向右，每隔 `x` 公尺就拔一根蘿蔔，請輸出 Ariel
今天總共收成了幾根蘿蔔，並告訴他現在農場的情況。\
\
`farm[N]` 表示農場狀況，若 `farm[i]` 為 1 ，表示在 index 為 `i`
時，有種一根蘿蔔 ; 若 `farm[i]` 為 0 ，表示在 index 為 `i`
時，沒有種蘿蔔。( index `i` 與 `i+1` 之間表示間隔為一公尺)

**Notice**: 請完成 `pull_radish`
函式，並回傳總共拔了幾個蘿蔔，注意參數是什麼 !

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In happy farm, Ariel planted `N` radishes. The radishes are spaced at
one-meter intervals. It is time to harvest, but Ariel doesn\'t want to
pull all radishes. Therefore, she deicides to start with herself
(starting point is `y`), and pulls radishes every `x` meters to left and
right, respectively. Please output how many radishes Ariel pulls and the
situation of farm.

`farm[N]` represents the situation of farm. If `farm[i]` is 1, that
means there is a radish at index `i` ; If `farm[i]` is 0, that means
there isn\'t a radish at index `i`.

**Notice**: Please finish `pull_radish` function, and return the number
of radishes that Ariel pulls. Pay attention to the parameter!

</div>

### Input

There are three number, integer N , y and x, represent the number of
radishes, Ariel\'s position and the interval.

### Output

Output the total of radishes which Ariel pulled and the array farm\[N\]

\[15 points\] PageRank
----------------------

### Description

<div>

**PageRank** is an algorithm that used by Google to sort the searching
result. This algorithm calculates the rank of a page via the quality and
the number of hyperlinks that point to it. The algorithm supposes that
there are many hyperlinks point to a web page if it is important.

A higher PageRank indicates the website is more important. On the other
hand, the PageRank of a web page is the probability of a user who visits
a hyperlink on a web page randomly and finally reaches the target one.
Thus, the PageRank should be an number lies between 0 and 1, and the sum
of PageRank of all web pages should be 1.

The following figure is an example: Given three web pages A, B and C.
Web page B and C are referenced by A, C is referenced by B and finally A
is referenced by C.

![fig1.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/2021_midterm/%5B15%20points%5D%20PageRank/images/a549cc9a107dde439d630d3869030fdd2bdd7c3b.png)Each
web page starts with an equal importance which is as known as PR. Since
the sum of all PRs should be 1, the PR of each web page is initialized
to 1/N, the N indicates the number of web pages, which is 3 in this
case, thus the PR of each web page is initially 1/3.

Next, the PRs are updated by the number of hyperlinks. We may imagine
that a web page X references another web page Y as \"X votes to Y\". If
X only has reference to Y, than Y gets 1 point from X; but if both Y and
Z are referenced by X, they should share the point voted by X. Thus,
each of them gets 1/2 point. Moreover, a vote by an important web page
should be concerned more valuable than a vote by a less important web
page. To present this thought, the point voted by X should be multiplied
by its own PR. As shown in the following figure, A votes to B and C,
which makes both B and C gets 1/2 \* 1/3 = 1/6 points.

![fig3.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/2021_midterm/%5B15%20points%5D%20PageRank/images/5355b8ba69c8834a2a0ae5da7a4977085a044e70.png)The
points voted to a web page are summed up to be the new PR of the web
page. For example, as shown in the above figure, the new PR of web page
C is 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2. After several iterations over the steps mentioned
above, the PR of a web page will converge to a fixed value which becomes
the PageRank of it.

As following animation presents: after repeating the process with enough
times (20 iterations in this case), the PR of each web page is 0.4, 0.2
and 0.4 respectively. The values will remain unchanged in the further

The PR of a web page `u` at the given time `t` can be written in to
following equation:

`PR(t, u) = sum( PR(t - 1, v) / L(v) ) for all v link to u`

where `v` indicates a web page that references `u`, and `L(v)` indicates
the number of hyperlinks in the web page `v`.

Now, given a set of web pages and the hyperlinks of each web page in the
set, please calculate the PR of each web page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PageRank**，又稱**網頁排名**，是Google公司所使用的對其搜尋引擎搜尋結果中的網頁進行排名的一種演算法，他本質上是一種以網頁之間的超連結個數和品質作為主要因素粗略地分析網頁的重要性的演算法。其基本假設是：更重要的頁面往往會有更多其他頁面擁有通向該頁面的超連結，因此我們可以透過「一個網頁有多少很重要的網頁通向他」來計算一個網頁的
PageRank。PageRank 愈高，就表示這個網頁愈重要。在實質意義上，PageRank
可以視為：「有一個使用者不斷在進入一個網站後，隨機點擊頁面上的超連結，最後會抵達某網頁的機率值」。因此，所有網頁的
PageRank 都應該介於 0 - 1 之間，並且總和應該要是 1。

我們來看一個簡單的例子：給定一個網頁的集合，該集合內有 A, B, C
三個網頁。其中 A 當中有通向 B 和 C 的超連結，B 當中有通向 C 的超連結，C
當中有通向 A 的超連結。如下圖所示：

![fig1.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/2021_midterm/%5B15%20points%5D%20PageRank/images/a549cc9a107dde439d630d3869030fdd2bdd7c3b.png)一開始所有人的重要程度都是一樣的，我們把重要程度叫作
PR，並且因為總和要是 1，所以大家的 PR 都要被初始化為 1 / N，其中 N
是這個集合的大小。在這個例子當中 N = 3，所以每個人一開始的 PR 都會是
1/3。

接著我們要透過超連結的數量來更新 PR 值。我們把「X 有一個通向 Y
的超連結」想像成是「X 投了票給 Y」，如果 X 只有投給 Y 的話，那麼 X
就是投了 1 票給 Y；但如果 X 同時投給 Y 跟 Z，那麼就視為 X 各投了 0.5
票給 Y 跟
Z。但不同重要性的網頁投的一票應該有不同的價值，如果一個網頁被一個影響力很高的網頁投了一票，他的重要性應該會比只有被一個不重要的網站投了一票還要更高的。我們必須把
X 的重要性考量進得票分數當中，由於 PR
愈高就表示一個網頁愈重要，因此我們可以把 X 投出的票數乘上他的 PR
值，來反應他的重要程度。在這個例子當中，A 一開始的 PR 值是 1/3，他分別給
B 跟 C 各投了一票，所以 B 跟 C 分別得到了 1/6 分，如下圖所示。

![fig3.png](https://ncchen99.github.io/ckjudgedumper/ckjudge/2021_midterm/%5B15%20points%5D%20PageRank/images/5355b8ba69c8834a2a0ae5da7a4977085a044e70.png)所有人的投票都確定之後，我們可以把一個網頁的得分給加總起來，就是該網頁的新的
PR 值。例如上圖中 C 網頁的 PR 值就是 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/2 =
0.5。透過不斷迭代這個計算過程，最後所有網頁的 PR

20 次）之後，這三個網頁的 PR 值分別會是 0.4, 0.2,
0.4，接著就算再重複更多次，三個網頁的 PR 值也會維持在這個數字不動。

我們可以形式化的將上述問題描述成以下格式：在任意時間點 `t` ，一個網頁
`u` 的 PR 值 `PR(t, u)` 為

`PR(t, u) = sum( PR(t - 1, v) / L(v) ) for all v link to u`

其中 `v` 是一個有超連結通向網頁 `u` 的網頁，`L(v)` 是 `v`
網頁中的超連結總數（也就是他總共連出去到幾個網頁）。

現在，給定你一個網頁的集合，以及該集合中的每個網頁通向哪些網頁，請你計算出每一個頁面的
PageRank。

</div>

### Input

The first line is an integer N (3 \<= N \<= 100), indicates the number
of web page in the set. The following N lines contains several integers,
which indicate the index of referenced pages. For example: the 1st line
contains 1, 2, which means page 0 has hyperlinks that link to page 1 and
page 2. Each line will end with -1 that indicates the termination of
that line.

### Output

N percentage numbers rounded to 2 decimal place that indicate PageRank
of each web page. For example, if PageRank of a web page is 0.2, you
should print \"20.00%\" for that page.

\[15 Points\] The coordinate to the past
----------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

Matsumoto is a brilliant AI that is built and sent to the past to
prevent a war between humans and AI. When on his way back to the past,
he will receive a set of encoded coordinates indicating where to go.

To decode the coordinates, he has to follow the following steps:

1\. split the received line of characters into two groups: characters at
odd positions and characters at even positions (index starts by 0 and
from left)

2\. sum up the numbers in each group

3\. write these two numbers into hexadecimal

4\. process the two numbers from step 1 if the length of the number is
greater than 1

5\. the coordinate is the concatenate of the result of the two numbers
(the even one on the left)

The following figure presents an example of the previously shown steps:

松本是個聰明的人工智慧，創造他的人想要將他送回過去阻止一場人類與人工智慧的戰爭。在他穿越的過程中，他會收到一份經過編碼的目的地座標，想要將座標解碼需要透過以下的步驟：

1.  將收到的所有字元分成奇數位與偶數位兩組（從最左邊的開始編號，並且從0開始）

2.  分別計算兩組數字的和

3.  將兩個相加的結果以16進位表示

4.  若有和的位數大於1的，則重複上述步驟

5.  將兩組數字計算的結果串接起來（偶數組的結果在左邊，奇數組的在右邊）

下面是範例二的示意圖：

</div>

### Input

A newline character terminated string indicates the encoded coordinate.
The length of the string will be greater than 1 and less than 10001.
Each character represents a hexadecimal, the upper case and the lower
case are both possible. 一行以換行字元結尾的字串，代表經過編碼的座標。
該字串的長度介於1到10001間（不包含10001）。
字串中每個字元代表一個16進位數字，且大小寫都有可能。

### Output

A single line that indicates the decoded coordinate, the letter of the
coordinate should be shown in lower case (if any).
解碼後的字串，若字串中有出現英文字母一律以小寫表示。

\[20 Points\] Paper Referencing
-------------------------------

### Description

<div>

It is usual that a paper may have many references. Probably a website, a
book, or other papers.

Assume that if we want to understand a specific paper, we need to read
the paper and its all references.

(If the referenced paper has other references, all of them should be
read.)

In this problem, given some reference numbers,

write a program that lists all papers that should be read for the
specific paper.

For the first sample testcase, given a number `5`, which means there are
five papers (number 1 \~ 5),

then, follow the format 「referencingPaper referencedPaper1
referencedPaper2 \...」 to input.

We can know that,

the 5th paper references the 1st 2nd 3rd papers

the 2nd paper references the 4th paper

the 1st paper references the 2nd paper

the 3rd paper references the 4th paper

until we encounter 0, stop inputting.

Now, if we want to fully understand all these five papers, then

for the 1st paper, we should read the 1st, 2nd, 4th papers (since the
1st paper references the 2nd paper, and the 2nd paper references the 4th
paper)

for the 2nd paper, we should read the 2nd, 4th papers

for the 3rd paper, we should read the 3rd, 4th papers

for the 4th paper, we should read the 4th paper

for the 5th paper, we should read the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th papers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

在一篇論文中，通常會有許多參考文獻，可能是某個網站、某本書、或是其他相關論文。

假設要完整個理解某篇論文，需要完整看完自身內容，以及其參考文獻（若類推下去仍有參考文獻，亦須將其完整看完）。

本題以此概念為出發，給予許多篇的論文編號，

請寫出一個程式，條列出透徹每篇論文所須看的所有論文編號。

以第一筆範例測資來說，給予一數字 `5`，代表有著五篇論文（編號 1 \~ 5），

接下來以「參考論文 被參考論文1 被參考論文2 \...」的格式進行輸入。

因此可以解讀出以下訊息：

第 5 篇論文參考了第 1、2、3 篇論文

第 2 篇論文參考了第 4 篇論文

第 1 篇論文參考了第 2 篇論文

第 3 篇論文參考了第 4 篇論文

直到遇到 0，代表輸入結束。

那麼若要透徹這五篇論文，則

第 1 篇論文應閱讀完第 1、2、4 篇論文（因為第 1 篇論文參考了第 2
篇論文，而第 2 篇論文又參考了第 4 篇論文）

第 2 篇論文應閱讀完第 2、4 篇論文

第 3 篇論文應閱讀完第 3、4 篇論文

第 4 篇論文應閱讀完第 4 篇論文

第 5 篇論文應閱讀完第 1、2、3、4、5 篇論文。

</div>

### Input

The first line is an integer N, and it means there are N papers (number
1 \~ N). And 1 \<= N \<= 100. Then follow the format 「referencingPaper
referencedPaper1 referencedPaper2 \...」 to input until encounter 0.
Notice that the referencing paper number on each row won\'t be ordered.
You don\'t need to consider the cycle. (If the 1st paper references the
3rd paper, and the 3rd paper references the 1st paper, well, it sounds
weird!) 一開始輸入一數字 N，代表有 N 篇論文，編號為 1 \~ N，且 1 \<= N
\<= 100。 接者以「參考論文 被參考論文1 被參考論文2
\...」的格式進行輸入， 直到讀到 0 代表輸入結束。
注意，每列的參考論文編號並不會按照順序， 且不必考慮 cycle
的狀況（如果說第 1 篇論文參考第 3 篇論文，而第 3 篇論文卻又參考了第 1
篇論文，聽起來超怪的對吧！）。

### Output

Print each paper number in ascending order on each row. Then follow the
format 「referencingPaper -\> readPaper1 readPaper2 \...」. Notice that

\[20 Points\] PK high school transfer student
---------------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

In PK high school, there is a transfer student. **The student number is
sorted by their name.**

Following are the student number sorting rules:

\- Sorted by the letter of name, if the letter is closer to A, the
student number is smaller. (For instance, the student number of `Chloe`
is smaller than that of `Sam` because compare with `C` and `S`, `C` is
closer to `A`)

\- It is no different between lowercase and uppercase (ex. `AMY` and
`amy` are the same)

\- In this case, `Sam` and `Samuel`, the letters of `Sam` is the same as
the first three letters of `Samuel`, but the length of `Sam` is shorter
than that of `Samuel`, `Sam`\'s student number is smaller than `Samuel`.

Here is an example.

There are two students in class. The name of those students are `nendou`
and `saiki`.

The transfer student\'s name is `saiko`.

Let\'s compare `nendou` and `saiko` first. Because the order of `n` is
smaller than `s`, the student number of `nendou` is smaller than
`saiko`.

Next, compare `saiki` and `saiko`. Because the first four letter of
their name are the same, compare the 5th letter. Because the order of
`i` is smaller than `o`, the student number of `saiki` is smaller than
`saiko`.

In this case, transfer student `saiko` \'s student number is 3.

Please help transfer student to find his/her student number.

p.s The transfer student\'s name won\'t be the same as the student\'s
name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

呀咧呀咧，新學期PK學園又來了個新轉學生，在這裡所有的學生
**座號都是使用名字拼音排序** 的。

排序的規則為

-   從名字拼音的開始排序，比較接近 `a` 的座號會比較前面

<!-- -->

-   大小寫字母沒有分別 (ex. `AMY` 與 `amy` 視作完全相同)

<!-- -->

-   如果剛好出現轉學生全名與班上學生某姓名的前面字母完全相等，或班上某學生全名與轉學生姓名前面字母完全相等，則名字較短的座號會比較前面。
    (ex. `Sam` 與 `Samuel`， `Sam` 的座號會比較小)

現在來舉個例子：

班上有兩個學生，分別是 `nendou` 與 `saiki`，

轉學生的名字叫 `saiko`。

先來比較 `nendou` 與 `saiko` ，按照英文 26 個字母的排序，`n` 比 `s`
來得更前面，所以 `nendou` 的座號在 `saiko` 之前。

再比較 `saiki` 與 `saiko` ，由於前四個字母皆為 `saik`
，比較第五個字母，由於 `i` 在 `o` 之前，所以 `saiki` 的座號也在 `saiko`
之前。

在這個範例裡，新轉學生 `saiko` 的座號就是 3。

每個學期都會出現新的轉學生，可以請你幫轉學生找到他的座號嗎？

p.s 不會出現班上同學與轉學生撞名的狀況

\[25 Points\] Railway Timetable
-------------------------------

### Description

<div>

Ariel is traveling around Taiwan by scooter. Unfortunately, her scooter
broke down when she arrived in Taipei. Therefore, Ariel plans to take
the train from Taipei to Tainan.\
There are `n` trains. Each train has different number `x`, departure
time `HH:MM` (0\<=`HH`\<=23, 0\<=`MM`\<=59) and running time `y`
minutes. Current time is `hh:mm`, please tell Ariel which train that she
can take arrives in Tainan earliest.\
**\
Note 1.** Ariel only takes the train after `hh:mm`(including `hh:mm`)

**Note 2.** Timetable is sorted from 00:00 to 23:59.

**Note 3.** Probably train A departs earlier than train B, but train A
arrives later than train B ; train A departs later than train B, but
train A arrives earlier than train B. (referring to Sample 2)\
**Note 4.** Ariel must can take the train to Tainan.\
**Note 5.** Trains arrive in Tainan at different times. That means,
there is only one answer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Ariel
以台南為起點騎車環島，騎車到了台北後，車子拋錨了，只好改搭火車回家，當天的火車時刻表上共有
`n` 班火車，每班火車都有不相同的編號 `x`，發車時間為 `HH:MM`
(0\<=`HH`\<=23, 0\<=`MM`\<=59)，需要花費 `y`
分鐘才能抵達台南，此時時間為 `hh:mm`，請問 Ariel
應該要搭哪一班火車才能最早抵達台南?\
\
**註1.** Ariel 只能搭 `hh:mm` 以後的火車 (包含 `hh:mm`)

**註2.** 火車時刻表上的發車時間是從 00:00 開始排序下來的

**註3.**
有可能比較早發車的火車比較晚抵達台南;比較晚發車的火車比較早抵達台南
**(可參考 sample 2)**

**註4.** 一定有火車可以搭回台南

**註5.** 火車抵達台南的時間皆不同，即答案只會有一個\

</div>

### Input

\[25 Points\] Trithemius Cipher Encoder
---------------------------------------

### Description

<div>

Do you remember [Caesar
cipher](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/L6vddcFTIix4)? One similar
technique is **Trithemius cipher**, it is a successive shift cipher. In
the case of Caesar cipher, each character in the plaintext message is
shifted with a fixed offset `k`. As for **Trithemius cipher**, a
successive shift (it could be ascending or descending, each time it
shift 1) and the offset `k` is added to each character.

For example: `k=1` , ascending, and the message we want to encode is
`TAs are so H4ND5OME`. The offset of each character is:

1.  `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

2.  `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14`

The cipher text becomes `UCv ewk zw Q4XO5AZS`.

Write a program that prints out the result of Trithemius cipher for the
given input (described in Input Format).

Note: Transform only **english alphabet (case-preserving)** and preserve
other characters such as Arabic numerals or punctuation. The successive
shift only occurs on english alphabet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

還記得[凱薩密碼](https://ckj.imslab.org/#/problems/L6vddcFTIix4)嗎？有個類似的加密方式是**特里特米烏斯密碼**。在凱薩密碼中，每個字元都會被平移一個固定的值`k`，而**特里特米烏斯密碼密碼**則會額外多加一個連續的偏移值(會是遞增或遞減，每次移動1)。

舉例來說，
`k=1`、遞增的狀況下，我們想加密`TAs are so H4ND5OME`，而每個字元的偏移量為：

1.  `T A s a r e s o H N D O M E`

2.  `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14`

加密文字會是`UCv ewk zw Q4XO5AZS`.

請撰寫一支程式來加密給定的訊息。

註：只需轉換英文字母(需保留大小寫)並保留其他字元例如阿拉伯數字、標點符號等等。連續偏移量只會在遇到英文字母時增減。

### Input

The first line is an integer k, where -2147483648 \<= k \<= 2147483647.
The second line contains a character \'a\' or \'d\' which indicates that
it is ascending or descending. The third line is the message that you
need to encode. Each line is ended with a newline character.
